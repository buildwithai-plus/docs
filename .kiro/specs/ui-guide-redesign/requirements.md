# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current UI & Styling Guide is too technical and overwhelming for beginners. Users need a clear, step-by-step guide that teaches them how to style their React Native app using the three main systems: themes, NativeWind, and React Native Reusables. The guide should be structured as a learning journey, starting with the basics and building up to more complex examples.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a beginner developer, I want to understand what each styling system does, so that I know when and how to use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the introduction THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what themes, NativeWind, and React Native Reusables are in simple terms
2. WHEN a user reads the introduction THEN the system SHALL provide a visual analogy or metaphor to help them understand how the three systems work together
3. WHEN a user reads the introduction THEN the system SHALL show a simple before/after example of unstyled vs styled components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer new to NativeWind, I want to learn basic styling step-by-step, so that I can style my first component successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the NativeWind section THEN the system SHALL start with the most basic styling example (like adding padding and background)
2. WHEN a user follows the NativeWind tutorial THEN the system SHALL provide 3-5 progressive examples that build in complexity
3. WHEN a user learns NativeWind classes THEN the system SHALL group them by purpose (spacing, colors, layout) with clear explanations
4. WHEN a user sees NativeWind examples THEN the system SHALL show both the code and describe what visual effect it creates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize my app's colors easily, so that I can match my brand without breaking the design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to change colors THEN the system SHALL provide a simple step-by-step process to modify theme colors
2. WHEN a user changes theme colors THEN the system SHALL explain where to find the global.css file
3. WHEN a user modifies colors THEN the system SHALL provide a color picker tool or HSL converter reference
4. WHEN a user changes colors THEN the system SHALL show a before/after example of the color change in action
5. WHEN a user sets colors THEN the system SHALL explain how light/dark mode works automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add pre-built components to my app, so that I can build interfaces quickly without starting from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to add components THEN the system SHALL provide the exact command to install each component type
2. WHEN a user installs components THEN the system SHALL show them where the component files are created
3. WHEN a user uses components THEN the system SHALL provide copy-paste ready examples for the most common components (Button, Card, Input)
4. WHEN a user sees component examples THEN the system SHALL show different variants and how to use them
5. WHEN a user adds components THEN the system SHALL explain how to customize them after installation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see complete, realistic examples, so that I can understand how to combine all three systems in real app screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the basics THEN the system SHALL provide 2-3 complete screen examples (like login form, profile card, settings list)
2. WHEN a user sees complete examples THEN the system SHALL annotate the code to explain which system is being used for each part
3. WHEN a user follows complete examples THEN the system SHALL provide the exact imports and file structure needed
4. WHEN a user builds complete examples THEN the system SHALL show the final visual result

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want quick reference materials, so that I can find the information I need while coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs quick reference THEN the system SHALL provide a cheat sheet of the most common NativeWind classes
2. WHEN a user needs colors THEN the system SHALL provide a quick reference of all theme color variables
3. WHEN a user needs components THEN the system SHALL provide a list of available React Native Reusables components with installation commands
4. WHEN a user has questions THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting tips for common styling issues
