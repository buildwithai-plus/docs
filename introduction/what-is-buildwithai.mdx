### Why Use a Boilerplate?

Building a mobile app from scratch involves dozens of repetitive setup tasks:

- Setting up authentication flows
- Setting up in-app purchases
- Configuring push notifications
- Establishing styling systems
- Adding analytics tracking
- And more...

BuildWithAI+ handles all these common requirements for you, allowing you to focus on the unique features that make your app stand out.

### Built With Modern Technologies

The boilerplate is built on the strongest foundation for cross-platform mobile development:

- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** - The industry-standard framework for building cross-platform mobile apps
- **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)** - The most powerful toolchain for React Native development
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)** - Open-source Firebase alternative for auth and backend
- **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)** - TailwindCSS for React Native
- **[Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/routing/introduction/)** - File-based routing for React Native

The combination of these technologies creates a powerful, flexible foundation for building any kind of mobile application.
