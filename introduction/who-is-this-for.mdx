## Skill Level Requirements

BuildWithAI+ is designed to be accessible while still providing powerful capabilities:

- **Beginner-friendly**: If you have basic React knowledge, you can start using the boilerplate effectively. The documentation guides you through all the key concepts.
- **Advanced-ready**: For experienced developers, the architecture is clean and extensible, allowing you to customize and extend as needed.

## When BuildWithAI+ is Perfect for You

You'll find BuildWithAI+ especially valuable if:

- You want to launch a quality mobile app in weeks, not months
- You need multiple complex integrations (auth, push, analytics, etc.)
- You're building a freemium or subscription-based application
- You want a solid architectural foundation that can scale
- You prefer not to reinvent solutions for common mobile app requirements
- You're looking for best practices in React Native development

## When to Consider Alternatives

While BuildWithAI+ is versatile, it might not be the ideal fit if:

- You're building an extremely simple app with no need for auth, push notifications, or other advanced features
- You have very specific architectural requirements that differ significantly from React Native community standards
- You're exclusively targeting web platforms (though the boilerplate can be adapted for web)
- You're building highly specialized apps that require custom native modules not covered by Expo or its compatible libraries

## Technical Requirements

To use BuildWithAI+ effectively, your development environment should include:

- Node.js 16+
- Git
- Basic command-line knowledge
- iOS and/or Android development environment (for testing)
- Expo account (free)
