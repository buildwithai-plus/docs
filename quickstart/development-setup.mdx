<Steps>
  <Step title="Install EAS CLI">
    Copy and paste this command into your terminal and press Enter to install the EAS CLI globally on your development machine:

    ```bash
    npm install -g eas-cli
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in to Expo">
    You'll need an Expo account to use EAS. If you don't have one, sign up at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/signup).

    Copy and paste this command into your terminal and press Enter to log in:

    ```bash
    eas login
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Build Profiles">
    Now let's set up your project for building. Run this command:

    ```bash
    eas build:configure
    ```

    You'll see two prompts:

    1. `Would you like to automatically create an EAS project for [your-app-name]?`  
       ✅ Type `y` and press Enter

    2. `Which platforms would you like to configure for EAS Build?`  
       ✅ Press Enter to select `All` (it's selected by default)

    This will:
    - Create your project on EAS
    - Link your local project to EAS
    - Generate an `eas.json` file with build settings
  </Step>
