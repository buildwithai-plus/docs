## Setting up Supabase

<Note>
  If you're here while waiting for your development build to complete, you're in the right place! This setup can be done in parallel and will be ready when your build finishes.
</Note>

The BuildWithAI boilerplate uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication and database. Follow these steps to set up your backend:

### Create Supabase Project

1. **Create a new project on Supabase** [here](https://supabase.com)
   - Sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create a new project**
   - Click **New Project**
   - Choose a name for your project
   - Set a database password
   - Select the region closest to your users
   - Click **Create Project**

### Project Credentials

1. **Get your API keys**
   - Once the project is ready, go to **Project Settings** → **API**
   - Copy the "Project URL" and "anon/public" key

2. **Add to your app**
   - Open the `.env` file you created earlier from `.env.example`
   - Update with your copied credentials:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### URL Configuration

Set up the authentication URLs for your development build:

1. In your project dashboard, go to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**

2. Configure these settings:
   - **Site URL**: Your app scheme from `app.json` + `://` (e.g., `travelapp://`)
   - **Redirect URLs**: Your app scheme + `://**` (e.g., `travelapp://**`)

<Info>
  If you want to quickly test the app with Expo Go before moving to development builds:
  1. Go to **Authentication** → **Sign In / Providers** → **Email**
  2. Toggle off **Confirm email** under the Email provider settings
  
  **Important**: Remember to re-enable this setting before you deploy to production for proper security.
