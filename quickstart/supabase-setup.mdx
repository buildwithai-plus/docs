## Setting up Supabase Authentication

The BuildWithAI+ boilerplate uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as its authentication provider, giving you access to multiple authentication methods, user management, and secure session handling. This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase authentication for your mobile app.

### Creating a Supabase Project

1. **Create a Supabase account**:
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://database.new) and sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create a new project**:
   - Click "New Project" in the Supabase dashboard
   - Fill in your project details:
     - Name: Choose a name for your project
     - Database Password: Just use the existing one (DON'T share it)
     - Region: Choose a region closest to your target users
   - Click "Create project"

3. **Wait for project initialization**:
   - This may take a few minutes while Supabase provisions your database and authentication services

### Configuring Your Project

Once your Supabase project is created, you'll need to get your project credentials:

1. **Get your project URL and anon key**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy the "URL" and "anon/public" key

2. **Add credentials to your app**:
   - Open the `.env` file you created earlier from `.env.example`
   - Update your Supabase credentials:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### URL Configuration for Authentication

1. **Configure authentication settings**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
   - Configure the following settings:

#### Site URL

- Set your site URL to your app's scheme that you configured in `app.json` with `://` at the end (e.g., `your-scheme://`)
- For Expo Go development, use `exp://localhost:8081` 

#### Redirect URLs

Add the following redirect URLs:

- Your app scheme followed by `://**` (e.g., `your-scheme://**`)
- For Expo Go, use `exp://localhost:8081/**`

<Tip>
  The scheme is used when your app runs as a standalone build (development build, production app), while the Expo Go URLs are used during development with Expo Go.
</Tip>

### Testing Authentication

Once your Supabase project is set up with the correct URL configuration, you can test the authentication flow:

1. **Run your app** in development mode
2. **Navigate to the sign-up screen**
3. **Create a test account** using email/password
4. **Check your email** for a confirmation link
5. **Open the confirmation link** on your phone
6. **Click 'Allow'** when your browser prompts you to open your app

If the authentication flow works successfully, you'll be automatically signed in and able to access protected routes in your app. You can then test signing out and signing back in with your credentials.

### What's Next

Now that you have set up authentication with Supabase, the next step is to configure your app settings before creating a development build.
