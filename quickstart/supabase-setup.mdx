## Setting up Supabase

The BuildWithAI boilerplate uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication and database. This guide will walk you through the initial setup.

### Creating a Supabase Project

1. **Create a Supabase account**:
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://database.new) and sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create a new project**:
   - Click "New Project" in the Supabase dashboard
   - Fill in your project details:
     - Name: Choose a name for your project
     - Database Password: Just use the existing one (DON'T share it)
     - Region: Choose a region closest to your target users
   - Click "Create project"

3. **Wait for project initialization**:
   - This may take a few minutes while Supabase provisions your database and authentication services

### Configuring Your Project

Once your Supabase project is created, you'll need to get your project credentials:

1. **Get your project URL and anon key**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy the "URL" and "anon/public" key

2. **Add credentials to your app**:
   - Open the `.env` file you created earlier from `.env.example`
   - Update your Supabase credentials:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### URL Configuration for Development

1. **Configure authentication settings**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
   - Configure the following settings:

#### Development Build Configuration

Configure the URL settings for your development build:

1. **Site URL**: 
   - Set to your app scheme (e.g., `myapp://`)

2. **Redirect URLs**:
   - Add `myapp://**` (replace 'myapp' with your actual app scheme)

<Tip>
  If you want to quickly test the app with Expo Go before moving to development builds:
  1. Go to **Authentication** → **Email Templates**
  2. Toggle off **Enable email confirmations**
  
  This is only for initial Expo Go testing. We'll create a proper development build with EAS in the next section.
