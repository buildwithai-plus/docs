## Setting up Supabase

The BuildWithAI+ boilerplate uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication and database. This guide will walk you through the initial setup.

### Creating a Supabase Project

1. **Create a Supabase account**:
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://database.new) and sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create a new project**:
   - Click "New Project" in the Supabase dashboard
   - Fill in your project details:
     - Name: Choose a name for your project
     - Database Password: Just use the existing one (DON'T share it)
     - Region: Choose a region closest to your target users
   - Click "Create project"

3. **Wait for project initialization**:
   - This may take a few minutes while Supabase provisions your database and authentication services

### Configuring Your Project

Once your Supabase project is created, you'll need to get your project credentials:

1. **Get your project URL and anon key**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy the "URL" and "anon/public" key

2. **Add credentials to your app**:
   - Open the `.env` file you created earlier from `.env.example`
   - Update your Supabase credentials:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### URL Configuration for Development

1. **Configure authentication settings**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
   - Configure the following settings:

#### For Expo Go Testing

When testing with Expo Go during initial development:

1. **Site URL**: 
   - Set to `exp://127.0.0.1:8081`

2. **Redirect URLs**:
   - Add `exp://127.0.0.1:8081/**`

<Tip>
  This configuration is for initial development with Expo Go. You'll update these URLs with your app's scheme when creating a development build later.
</Tip>

### Testing Basic Auth

Let's verify the setup with a basic email/password test:

1. **Run your app** in development mode
2. **Navigate to the sign-up screen**
3. **Create a test account** using email/password
4. **Check your email** for a confirmation link
5. **Open the confirmation link** on your phone
6. **Click 'Allow'** when your browser prompts you to open your app

If the authentication flow works successfully, you'll be automatically signed in.

### What's Next

Now that you have set up Supabase, you can proceed with configuring your app settings. Later, you can return to set up additional authentication methods like Google and Apple Sign-In in the Features section.
