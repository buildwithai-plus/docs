# Install Git

Git is required to clone the boilerplate code and manage your project versions. Here's how to install it:

## Step 1: Download Git

1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download Git for your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Download Git for Windows
   - **macOS**: Download Git for macOS
   - **Linux**: Use your package manager

## Step 2: Install Git

### Windows:
1. Run the downloaded installer
2. Follow the installation wizard with these recommended settings:
   - **Default editor**: Use Visual Studio Code (or keep default)
   - **PATH environment**: Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software
   - **Line ending conversions**: Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style
   - **Terminal emulator**: Use Windows' default console window
3. Click "Install" and wait for completion

### macOS:
**Option 1 - Installer:**
1. Run the downloaded installer
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. You may need to allow installation from "System Preferences > Security"

**Option 2 - Homebrew (if you have it):**
```bash
brew install git
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt update

# Install Git
sudo apt install git
```

## Step 3: Configure Git

After installation, set up your identity (required for commits):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Step 4: Verify Installation

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
git --version
```

You should see something like `git version 2.40.0` or higher.

## Troubleshooting

**Command not found?**
- Restart your terminal/command prompt
- On Windows, restart your computer
- Make sure Git was added to PATH during installation
