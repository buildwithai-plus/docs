Git is highly recommended for version control and tracking your project changes. It's a best practice for all developers.

## Install Git

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    2. Download Git for Windows
    3. Run the downloaded installer
    4. Follow the installation wizard with these recommended settings:
       - **Default editor**: Use Visual Studio Code (or keep default)
       - **PATH environment**: Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software
       - **Line ending conversions**: Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style
       - **Terminal emulator**: Use Windows' default console window
    5. Click **Install** and wait for completion
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="macOS">
    1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    2. Download Git for macOS
    3. Run the downloaded installer
    4. Follow the installation wizard
    5. You may need to allow installation from "System Preferences > Security"
    
    **Alternative - Homebrew (if you have it):**
    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    # Update package index
    sudo apt update
    
    # Install Git
    sudo apt install git
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure Git

After installation, set up your identity (required for commits):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Verify Installation

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
git --version
```

You should see something like `git version 2.40.0` or higher.

## Troubleshooting

**Command not found?**
- Restart your terminal/command prompt
- On Windows, restart your computer
- Make sure Git was added to PATH during installation
