## Development Builds

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up EAS">
    Before creating a development build, make sure you've completed the [EAS Setup](/quickstart/eas-setup) guide which covers:
    - Installing the EAS CLI
    - Logging in to Expo
    - Initializing your EAS project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Platform-Specific Setup">

      <Tab title="iOS">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="Enroll in Apple Developer Program">
            An active [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll) subscription is required (costs $99 per year).
          </Step>

          <Step title="Register Your Device & Install Provisioning Profile">
            ```bash
            eas device:create
            ```

            The command will walk you through these steps:

            1. **Confirm Expo Account**
               ```bash
               You're inside the project directory. Would you like to use the [your-expo-account-name] account? Â» (Y/n)
               ```
               Just press `Y` to continue with your current account

            2. **Sign in to Apple Developer**
               ```bash
               ? Apple ID: >> [your-apple-id] (if correct hit `Enter`)
               ```
               ```bash
               ? Password: >> (copy and paste your password)
               ```
            3. **Choose Registration Method**
               ```bash
               ? How would you like to register your devices?
               > Website - generates a registration URL ...
               ```
               Press `Enter` to use the website method (recommended)

          </Step>

          <Step title="Create iOS Development Build">
            <Tip>
              Before running the build command, check that `developmentClient` is set to `true` in your `eas.json` under the development profile.
            </Tip>

            Run the build command:
            ```bash
            eas build --platform ios --profile development
            # Or use the shorter version:
            eas build -p ios --profile development
            ```

            You'll be guided through these prompts:

            1. **Apple ID**  
               Enter your Apple ID credentials when prompted.

            2. **Team Selection**  
               Choose your Apple Developer team.

            3. **Bundle Identifier**

            4. **Push Notifications**  
               Press `Y` to enable push notifications capability.

            The build will begin in the cloud. You can monitor progress in the terminal or via the EAS dashboard.

            <Info>
              The build process takes about 10-15 minutes. While waiting, proceed to the [Supabase Setup](/quickstart/supabase-setup) guide, then return to [Install Development Build](/quickstart/install-development-build) once the build is complete.
