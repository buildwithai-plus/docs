  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    Once you have installed the development build on your device, start the development server:

    ```bash
    npx expo start -c  # -c clears the cache
    ```

    Then connect your device to the development server:

    1. Open the app on your device
    2. Log in to your Expo account by pressing the profile icon in the top right.
    3. Tap "Fetch development servers" and select your server from the list
    4. Or just scan the QR code from the terminal

    <Accordion title="Different Network? Use Tunnel Mode">
      If your phone isn't on the same WiFi as your computer (or the QR code doesn't work):

      1. Run this command instead: 
      ```bash
      npx expo start -c --tunnel
      ```
      2. When prompted to install the ngrok package, type `y` and press Enter
      3. A new QR code will appear - scan it with your phone

      <Tip>
        You can pre-install ngrok to avoid permission issues:
        ```bash
        # Install ngrok globally beforehand
        npm install -g @expo/ngrok
        ```

        If you still see permission errors:
        - **Windows:** Right-click on Command Prompt/PowerShell and select "Run as administrator"
        - **Mac:** Run `sudo npm install -g @expo/ngrok` and then try the tunnel command again
      </Tip>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Supabase URL Configuration">
    After successfully creating your development build, you need to update your Supabase authentication URL configuration to work with your app scheme:

    1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**
    2. **Navigate to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration**
    3. **Update the following settings**:

    #### Site URL
    - Set your site URL to your app's scheme that you configured in `app.json` with `://` at the end
    - Example: if your scheme is `myapp`, set it to `myapp://`

    #### Redirect URLs
    - Add your app scheme followed by `://**`
    - Example: `myapp://**`

    These scheme-based URLs are essential for proper authentication flow when using your development build, as they enable your app to handle authentication redirects correctly.
