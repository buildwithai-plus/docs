## Development Builds

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up EAS">
    Before creating a development build, make sure you've completed the [EAS Setup](/quickstart/eas-setup) guide which covers:
    - Installing the EAS CLI
    - Logging in to Expo
    - Initializing your EAS project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Platform-Specific Setup">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="iOS">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="Enroll in Apple Developer Program">
            An active [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll) subscription is required (costs $99 per year).
          </Step>

          <Step title="Register Your Device & Install Provisioning Profile">
            ```bash
            eas device:create
            ```

            The command will walk you through these steps:

            1. **Confirm Expo Account**
               ```bash
               You're inside the project directory. Would you like to use the [your-expo-account-name] account? Â» (Y/n)
               ```
               Just press `Y` to continue with your current account

            2. **Sign in to Apple Developer**
               ```bash
               ? Apple ID: >> [your-apple-id] (if correct hit `Enter`)
               ```
               ```bash
               ? Password: >> (copy and paste your password)
               ```
            3. **Choose Registration Method**
               ```bash
               ? How would you like to register your devices?
               > Website - generates a registration URL ...
               ```
               Press `Enter` to use the website method (recommended)

            On your iOS device:
            - Open your camera app
            - Scan the QR code from the terminal
            - Open the provided URL in your device's browser
            - Tap "Download Profile" button, and press "Continue" or "Allow" when prompted. 
            - Go to Settings app > Tap "Profile downloaded" > Tap "Install" and allow the installation.
            - After the device is registered, you'll be redirected to the browser, and see a success message.
            - Done!

    3. Tap "Fetch development servers" and select your server from the list
    4. Or just scan the QR code from the terminal

    <Info>
      Make sure your computer and device are on the same Wi-Fi network for the best development experience.
    </Info>

    <Accordion title="QR Code Not Working?">
      First, check your network setup:

      1. **Check Network Connection**
         - Make sure your computer and phone are using the same network
         - This could be the same Wi-Fi, or a hotspot connection
         - Check that you're not accidentally using different networks

      2. **Check Network Type** (if at home)
         - Your home network might be set as "Public" in your system settings
         - Try changing it to "Private" in your Wi-Fi settings

      If you still can't connect, or if you're on a public network (like at cafes, schools or libraries), you'll need to use tunnel mode:

      1. Install ngrok with admin privileges:
      <Tabs>
        <Tab title="Windows">
          ```bash
          # Run PowerShell as Administrator
          npm install --global @expo/ngrok
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
          ```bash
          sudo npm install --global @expo/ngrok
          ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>

      2. Start the tunnel:
      ```bash
      npx expo start --tunnel
      ```

      3. Scan the new QR code that appears

      <Info>
        Note: Tunnel mode is slower than a direct connection, so try to use the same network when possible.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Update Supabase URL Configuration

After successfully creating your development build, you need to update your Supabase authentication URL configuration to work with your app scheme:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Authentication â URL Configuration**
3. **Update the following settings**:

### Site URL
- Set your site URL to your app's scheme that you configured in `app.json` with `://` at the end
- Example: if your scheme is `myapp`, set it to `myapp://`

### Redirect URLs
- Add your app scheme followed by `://**`
- Example: `myapp://**`

These scheme-based URLs are essential for proper authentication flow when using your development build, as they enable your app to handle authentication redirects correctly.
