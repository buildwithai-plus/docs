### Step 1: Create Your Configuration File

Run this command in your terminal to create your config file:

```bash
cp app.json.example app.json
```

### Step 2: Update Your App Settings

Open `app.json` and replace the placeholder values with your actual app information:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Travel App",                    // ← Your app's display name
    "slug": "travel-app",                    // ← Your app's URL identifier
    "scheme": "travelapp",                   // ← Your app's deep link scheme
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.buildwithai.travelapp"  // ← Your unique iOS ID
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.buildwithai.travelapp"           // ← Your unique Android ID
    }
  }
}
```

### Understanding Each Setting

#### 1. **App Name** (`name`)
**What it is**: The name people see when they download your app from the App Store or Google Play.

**Format**: Normal words with spaces and capital letters

**Examples**:
- `"Travel App"`
- `"Fitness Tracker"`
- `"Recipe Book"`

---

#### 2. **App Slug** (`slug`)
**What it is**: A unique identifier used in URLs and file names. Think of it as your app's "username" on the internet.

**Format**: lowercase-letters-with-hyphens

**Examples**:
- `"Travel App"` → `"travel-app"`
- `"Fitness Tracker"` → `"fitness-tracker"`

⚠️ **Important**: You cannot change this after publishing your app!

---

#### 3. **App Scheme** (`scheme`)
**What it is**: A special code that lets other apps open your app directly. Like a "phone number" for your app.

**Format**: lowercaseletters (no spaces, no hyphens)

**Examples**:
- `"travel-app"` → `"travelapp"`
- `"fitness-tracker"` → `"fitnesstracker"`

<Info>
**Deep Linking Example**: When someone taps a link like `travelapp://bookings` in an email, their phone automatically opens your Travel App and goes to the bookings screen.
</Info>

---

#### 4. **Bundle Identifier** (`bundleIdentifier` for iOS & `package` for Android)
**What it is**: A unique "address" for your app that Apple and Google use to identify it. Like a postal address for your app.

**Format**: `com.[identifier].[slug]` (all lowercase, no spaces)

**Identifier options**:
- Your name: `johndoe`
- Your company: `acmecorp`
- Your domain: `mysite` (without .com)

**Examples**:
- `"travel-app"` → `com.johndoe.travelapp`
- `"fitness-tracker"` → `com.acmecorp.fitnesstracker`

⚠️ **Important**: The iOS `bundleIdentifier` and Android `package` must be exactly the same!

### Step 3: App Icons & Splash Screens

The boilerplate includes placeholder app icons and splash screens in the `assets/images/` folder. These placeholders are functional and allow you to continue with development, so you can customize them later when you're ready to brand your app.

<Info>
  For detailed instructions on creating and customizing your app icons, please see our [App Icons & Splash Screens Guide](/features/app-icons-guide).
</Info>

While not urgent for initial development, you'll want to replace these placeholders with your own branded assets before publishing to app stores.
