## Configure Your App

After setting up your project repository and Supabase authentication, the next step is to configure your app's essential settings and visual identity before creating a development build.

### Step 1: Configure App Settings

The boilerplate comes with an example configuration file. Start by renaming it to `app.json`:

```bash
cp app.json.example app.json
```

### Step 2: Configure App Icons & Splash Screens

Customizing your app's icons and splash screens helps create a professional, branded experience for your users.

#### Asset Requirements

##### App Icons

For the best results across all devices, prepare the following images:

| Asset | Size (pixels) | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| App Icon | 1024×1024 | The primary app icon, will be resized for various platforms |
| iOS Icon (Light Mode) | 1024×1024 | Optional icon variant for iOS light mode |
| iOS Icon (Dark Mode) | 1024×1024 | Optional icon variant for iOS dark mode |

<Tip>
  Use PNG format for your icons to ensure the best quality and transparency support.
</Tip>

##### Splash Screen

Prepare a splash screen image that:
- Is at least 1242×2436 pixels (iPhone X resolution)
- Has your app logo centered
- Uses a solid background color that matches your brand

#### Configuration

In your `app.json`, update the following sections:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
```

Place your icon and splash screen images in the `assets` folder of your project.

<Info>
  The boilerplate includes placeholder images that you can use as templates for sizing and positioning.
</Info>

### Step 3: Configure App Settings
```

Now, open the `app.json` file and update the following essential fields to customize your app:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "scheme": "your-app-scheme",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.owner.yourapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.owner.yourapp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  The boilerplate includes many more configuration options, but these are the essential fields you need to update before starting development.
</Tip>

#### Essential fields to update:

You'll need to modify these settings in your project's `app.json` file:

- **name**: The display name shown on users' devices (e.g., `Travel App`)  
  *Choose something descriptive and memorable*

- **slug**: Unique identifier used in URLs and directories (e.g., `travel-app`)  
  *Use lowercase letters and hyphens only*  
  **⚠️ Warning:** Cannot be changed after publishing!

- **scheme**: URL scheme for deep linking (e.g., `travelapp`)  
  *No spaces or special characters*

- **bundleIdentifier** (iOS): Unique identifier in Apple's ecosystem (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`)  
  *Use reverse domain notation where "owner" can be your name, domain, or company*

- **package** (Android): Unique identifier in Google's ecosystem (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`)  
  *Should match your iOS bundleIdentifier for consistency*

### Step 2: Customize App Icons and Splash Screens

<Info>
  Replace the default icons and splash screens in `assets/images/` with your own. See the [App Icons Guide](/features/app-icons) for creating custom assets with AI.
