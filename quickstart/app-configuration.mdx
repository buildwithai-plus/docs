## Configure Your App

After setting up your project repository and Supabase authentication, the next step is to configure your app's essential settings before creating a development build.

### Step 1: Configure App Settings

The boilerplate comes with an example configuration file. Start by renaming it to `app.json`:

```bash
cp app.json.example app.json
```

Now, open the `app.json` file and update the following essential fields to customize your app:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "scheme": "your-app-scheme",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.owner.yourapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.owner.yourapp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  The boilerplate includes many more configuration options, but these are the essential fields you need to update before starting development.
</Tip>

#### Essential fields to update:

You'll need to modify these settings in your project's `app.json` file:

- **name**: The display name shown on users' devices (e.g., `Travel App`)  
  *Choose something descriptive and memorable*

- **slug**: Unique identifier used in URLs and directories (e.g., `travel-app`)  
  *Use lowercase letters and hyphens only*  
  **⚠️ Warning:** Cannot be changed after publishing!

- **scheme**: URL scheme for deep linking (e.g., `travelapp`)  
  *No spaces or special characters*

- **bundleIdentifier** (iOS): Unique identifier in Apple's ecosystem (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`)  
  *Use reverse domain notation where "owner" can be your name, domain, or company*

- **package** (Android): Unique identifier in Google's ecosystem (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`)  
  *Should match your iOS bundleIdentifier for consistency*

### Step 2: Customize App Icons and Splash Screens

<Info>
  Replace the default icons and splash screens in `assets/images/` with your own. See the [App Icons Guide](/features/customization/app-icons) for creating custom assets with AI.
