## Configure Your App

After setting up your project repository and Supabase authentication, the next step is to configure your app's essential settings before creating a development build.

### Step 1: Configure App Settings

The boilerplate comes with an example configuration file. Start by renaming it to `app.json`:

```bash
cp app.json.example app.json
```

Now, open the `app.json` file and update the following essential fields to customize your app:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "scheme": "your-app-scheme",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  The boilerplate includes many more configuration options, but these are the essential fields you need to update before starting development.
</Tip>

#### Essential fields to update:

You'll need to modify these settings in your project's `app.json` file:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="name" icon="mobile-screen">
    **What it is**: The display name of your app as it will appear on users' devices
    
    **Example**: `FitTracker Pro` or `Recipe Finder`
    
    **Tip**: Choose something descriptive and memorable
  </Card>

  <Card title="slug" icon="link">
    **What it is**: A unique identifier for your project used in URLs and directories
    
    **Example**: `fittracker-pro` or `recipe-finder`
    
    **Rules**: Use lowercase letters, hyphens instead of spaces, no special characters
    
    **⚠️ WARNING**: The slug **cannot be changed** after publishing without creating a new project!
  </Card>

  <Card title="scheme" icon="arrow-right-to-bracket">
    **What it is**: A URL scheme for deep linking to your app from other apps or websites
    
    **Example**: `fittrackerapp` or `recipefinderapp`
    
    **Tip**: Choose something unique with no spaces or special characters
  </Card>

  <Card title="bundleIdentifier (iOS)" icon="apple">
    **What it is**: Your app's unique identifier in Apple's ecosystem
    
    **Example for individuals**: `io.github.username.appname` or `dev.yourname.appname`
    
    **Format**: Use reverse domain notation - for individuals without a company, use your GitHub username or personal domain
  </Card>

  <Card title="package (Android)" icon="android">
    **What it is**: Your app's unique identifier in Google's ecosystem
    
    **Example for individuals**: `io.github.username.appname` or `dev.yourname.appname`
    
    **Tip**: Should match your iOS bundleIdentifier for consistency
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 2: Customize App Icons and Splash Screens

<Info>
  Replace the default icons and splash screens in `assets/images/` with your own. See the [App Icons Guide](/features/customization/app-icons) for creating custom assets with AI.

### Step 3: Log in to Expo

You'll need an Expo account to use EAS Build. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).

Log in to your Expo account through the CLI:

```bash
eas login
```

Check if you are logged in:
```bash
eas whoami
```

### Step 4: Initialize EAS Project

Initialize your project with EAS (Expo Application Services):

```bash
eas init
```

This will connect your local project to Expo's cloud services and prepare it for building.

### Step 5: Configure EAS Build Profiles

The boilerplate includes pre-configured EAS build profiles in the `eas.json` file. Review and modify them as needed for your specific requirements.

For example:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "development"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "staging"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Next

After configuring your app, you're ready to create a development build to test on real devices.
