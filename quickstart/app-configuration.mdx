# Configure Your App

Let's set up your app's identity and basic configuration.

### Create Your Configuration

1. Create your config file by copying the example:

```bash
cp app.json.example app.json
```

2. Open `app.json` and update these essential settings:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",        // Change this to your app name (e.g., Travel App)
    "slug": "your-app-slug",        // Change this to your app slug (e.g., travel-app)
    "scheme": "your-app-scheme",     // Change this to your app scheme (e.g., travelapp)
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.owner.yourapp"  // Change to your unique bundle ID (e.g., com.buildwithai.travelapp)
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.owner.yourapp"          // Change to same ID as iOS bundleIdentifier (e.g., com.buildwithai.travelapp)
    }
  }
}
```

### Understanding the Settings

- **name**: Your app's display name in stores and on devices
  ✅ _Choose something descriptive and memorable_
- **slug**: Your app's URL and directory name
  ✅ _Use lowercase and hyphens_\
  ⚠️ _Cannot change after publishing\!_
- **scheme**: How other apps open yours\
  <Tooltip tip="Deep linking is like creating a special URL for your app. When someone taps a link like 'travelapp://bookings' (in an email or website), their phone knows to open your app directly to a specific screen. It's how apps connect to each other!">Enables deep linking</Tooltip>\
  ✅ _Use simple lowercase letters, no spaces or special characters_
- **bundleIdentifier** (iOS): Your app's unique iOS identifier
  ✅ _Format: com.owner.yourapp (replace 'owner' with your name/company/domain)_
- **package** (Android): Your app's unique Android identifier
  ✅ _Must match your iOS bundleIdentifier exactly for consistency_

### Step 3: Create App Icons & Splash Screens

Your app needs several icon variants for different platforms and modes. The boilerplate includes placeholder images that you can replace with your own designs.

#### Required Icons

In your `assets/images/` folder, you'll need:

- **Main App Icon** (`icon.png`, 1024×1024)\
  _Your primary icon used in app stores and as a fallback_
- **iOS Variants**:
  - `ios-icon-light.png` - _For light mode, visible on white backgrounds_
  - `ios-icon-dark.png` - _For dark mode, visible on black backgrounds_
  - `ios-icon-tinted.png` - _Special version that iOS can color-match to its theme_
- **Android Variants**:
  - `adaptive-icon.png` - _Foreground layer with center-focused design_
  - `adaptive-icon-monochrome.png` - _Single-color version for system themes_
- **Splash Screen** (`splash.png`, 1242×2436)\
  _The loading screen users see when opening your app_

#### Creating Your Icons

1. **Generate Base Icon**
   Use ChatGPT's image generator with this prompt:

   ```
   "Create a professional mobile app icon:
   - Modern [describe your app's purpose] symbol
   - 1024×1024 pixels, square format
   - Minimalist design with [your brand color]
   - Clean lines and subtle gradients
   - Bold, instantly recognizable shape
   - Transparent background
   - No text or tiny details"
   ```
2. **Create Variants**
   For each variant, show ChatGPT your base icon and ask:

   ```
   For dark mode:
   "Make this icon visible on dark backgrounds with lighter colors"
   
   For monochrome:
   "Convert this to a single-color black icon with transparency"
   
   For adaptive:
   "Adjust this icon to fit in the center 70% area for Android"
   ```
3. **Alternative Tools**
   - Use [Figma](https://www.figma.com) or [Canva](https://www.canva.com) for manual editing
   - Try [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen) for automatic Android variants

<Tip>
  Always test your icons at full size (1024×1024) and app size (180×180) to ensure they're clear at all sizes.

### Next Steps

Now that you've configured your app and prepared your icons, it's time to set up EAS Build. This will let you create development builds to test your app on real devices.
