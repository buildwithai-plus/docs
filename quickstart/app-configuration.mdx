### Create Your Configuration

1. Create your config file by copying the example:

```bash
cp app.json.example app.json
```

2. Open `app.json` and update these essential settings:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",        // Change this to your app name (e.g., Travel App)
    "slug": "your-app-slug",        // Change this to your app slug (e.g., travel-app)
    "scheme": "your-app-scheme",     // Change this to your app scheme (e.g., travelapp)
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.owner.yourapp"  // Change to your unique bundle ID (e.g., com.buildwithai.travelapp)
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.owner.yourapp"          // Change to same ID as iOS bundleIdentifier (e.g., com.buildwithai.travelapp)
    }
  }
}
```

### Understanding the Settings

- **name**: Your app's display name in stores and on devices
  ✅ _Choose something descriptive and memorable_
- **slug**: Your app's URL and directory name
  ✅ _Use lowercase and hyphens_\
  ⚠️ _Cannot change after publishing\!_
- **scheme**: How other apps open yours\
  <Tooltip tip="Deep linking is like creating a special URL for your app. When someone taps a link like 'travelapp://bookings' (in an email or website), their phone knows to open your app directly to a specific screen. It's how apps connect to each other!">Enables deep linking</Tooltip>\
  _Use simple lowercase letters, no spaces or special characters_
- **bundleIdentifier** (iOS): Your app's unique iOS identifier
  _Format: com.owner.yourapp (replace 'owner' with your name/company/domain)_
- **package** (Android): Your app's unique Android identifier
  _Must match your iOS bundleIdentifier exactly for consistency_

### Step 3: App Icons & Splash Screens

The boilerplate includes placeholder app icons and splash screens in the `assets/images/` folder. These placeholders are functional and allow you to continue with development, so you can customize them later when you're ready to brand your app.

<Info>
  For detailed instructions on creating and customizing your app icons, please see our [App Icons & Splash Screens Guide](/features/app-icons-guide).
</Info>

While not urgent for initial development, you'll want to replace these placeholders with your own branded assets before publishing to app stores.
