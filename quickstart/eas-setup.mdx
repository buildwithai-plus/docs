## Setting up EAS

[Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas) is a cloud service for building and deploying your app. This guide covers the initial EAS setup required before creating development builds.

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI

Install the EAS CLI globally on your development machine:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Log in to Expo

You'll need an Expo account to use EAS. If you don't have one, sign up at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/signup).

Log in through the CLI:

```bash
eas login
```

### Step 3: Configure Build Profiles

Run the build configuration command:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

This creates an `eas.json` file with standard EAS build profiles. For now, we'll use the `development` profile which is designed for testing on real devices.

<Tip>
  The `eas.json` file is automatically generated. You don't need to edit it for basic development.
