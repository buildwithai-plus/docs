## Setting up EAS

[Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas) is a cloud service for building and deploying your app. This guide covers the initial EAS setup required before creating development builds.

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI

Copy and paste this command into your terminal and press Enter to install the EAS CLI globally on your development machine:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Log in to Expo

You'll need an Expo account to use EAS. If you don't have one, sign up at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/signup).

Copy and paste this command into your terminal and press Enter to log in:

```bash
eas login
```

### Step 3: Configure Build Profiles

Now let's set up your project for building. Run this command:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

You'll see two prompts:

1. `Would you like to automatically create an EAS project for [your-app-name]?`  
   âœ… Type `y` and press Enter

2. `Which platforms would you like to configure for EAS Build?`  
   âœ… Press Enter to select `All` (it's selected by default)

This will:
- Create your project on EAS
- Link your local project to EAS
- Generate an `eas.json` file with build settings

ðŸŽ‰ Your project is now ready for the next steps!
