## Installing Your Development Build

### Check Network Setup First

<Info>
Before installing, make sure:
1. Your computer and phone are on the same Wi-Fi network
2. Your firewall isn't blocking the Expo server (allow Node.js if prompted)
3. Your antivirus isn't blocking local connections
4. Your Wi-Fi is set to "Private" network (not "Public")
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the App">
        After the build completes:
        1. Scan the QR code from the EAS dashboard or terminal
        2. Tap "Open with iTunes" when it appears in the Camera app
        3. Confirm installation when prompted
            
        The app will appear in your device's app library.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Enable Developer Mode">
        <Info>
          If you're using iOS 16 or newer, you'll need to enable Developer Mode on your iPhone to run development builds.
        </Info>

        1. Open Settings > Privacy & Security
        2. Scroll down and tap Developer Mode
        3. Toggle the switch to enable it
        4. Tap Restart in the security warning
        5. After restart, unlock your device
        6. Tap Turn On in the confirmation alert
        7. Enter your device passcode
      </Step>
    </Steps>

        After the build completes:
        1. Scan the QR code from the terminal or EAS dashboard
        2. Download the APK file when prompted
        3. If asked about "Install unknown apps":

  <Step title="Start the Server">
    Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Your Device">
    1. Open the app on your device
    2. Tap the profile icon in the top right
    3. Log in to your Expo account
    4. Tap "Fetch development servers"
    5. Select your server from the list

  ### Common Solutions

  1. **Check Server Status**
     - Make sure `npx expo start` is running
     - Look for any error messages in the terminal
     - Try stopping and restarting the server

  2. **Network Issues**
     - Confirm both devices show the same Wi-Fi name
     - Try using your phone as a hotspot instead
     - Check if your network is set to "Private" in Windows

  3. **Security Blocks**
     - Watch for firewall popups about Node.js or Expo
     - Check antivirus logs for blocked connections
     - Try temporarily disabling firewall/antivirus to test

  ### Use Tunnel Mode
  If you're on a restricted network or the above doesn't help:

  1. Install ngrok with admin privileges:
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Windows">
      ```bash
      npm install -g @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="macOS">
      ```bash
      sudo npm install -g @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  2. Start the tunnel:
  ```bash
  npx expo start --tunnel
  ```

  3. Scan the new QR code that appears

  <Info>
    Note: Tunnel mode is slower than a direct connection, so try to use the same network when possible.
