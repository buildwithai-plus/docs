            <Info>
              If you're using iOS 16 or newer, you'll need to enable Developer Mode on your iPhone to run development builds.

            2. Tap the switch to enable Developer Mode
               - You'll see a security warning alert
               - Tap Restart to continue

            1. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal or EAS dashboard
            2. Download the APK file when prompted
            3. When your browser asks to install the APK:
               - If prompted about "Install unknown apps", tap Settings
               - Enable installation permission for your browser
               - Go back and tap "Install"

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    Once you have installed the development build on your device, start the development server:

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

    Then connect your device to the development server:

    1. Open the app on your device
    2. Log in to your Expo account by pressing the profile icon in the top right
    3. Tap "Fetch development servers" and select your server from the list
    4. Or just scan the QR code from the terminal

    <Info>
      Make sure your computer and device are on the same Wi-Fi network for the best development experience.
    </Info>

    <Accordion title="QR Code Not Working?">
      First, check your network setup:

      1. **Check Network Connection**
         - Make sure your computer and phone are using the same network
         - This could be the same Wi-Fi, or a hotspot connection
         - Check that you're not accidentally using different networks

      2. **Check Network Type** (if at home)
         - Your home network might be set as "Public" in your system settings
         - Try changing it to "Private" in your Wi-Fi settings

      If you still can't connect, or if you're on a public network (like at cafes, schools or libraries), you'll need to use tunnel mode:

      1. Install ngrok with admin privileges:
      <Tabs>
        <Tab title="Windows">
          ```bash
          # Run PowerShell as Administrator
          npm install --global @expo/ngrok
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
          ```bash
          sudo npm install --global @expo/ngrok
          ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>

      2. Start the tunnel:
      ```bash
      npx expo start --tunnel
      ```

      3. Scan the new QR code that appears

      <Info>
        Note: Tunnel mode is slower than a direct connection, so try to use the same network when possible.
