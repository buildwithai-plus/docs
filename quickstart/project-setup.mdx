## Project Setup

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your BuildWithAI+ project from scratch, from cloning the repository to configuring your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Code editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- iOS/Android development environment:
  - For iOS: macOS with Xcode installed
  - For Android: Android Studio with SDK tools

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the BuildWithAI+ repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buildwithai/boilerplate.git your-app-name
cd your-app-name
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

<Note>
  If you encounter any issues during installation, try clearing your npm cache with `npm cache clean --force` and then run the install command again.
</Note>

### Step 3: Configure Your App

Update the app configuration in the `app.json` file with your project details:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    // Additional configuration...
  }
}
```

Key fields to update:
- `name`: The display name of your app
- `slug`: A unique identifier for your project (use lowercase, no spaces)
- `version`: Your app's version number
- `icon` and `splash`: Paths to your app icons and splash screen images

### Step 4: Log in to Expo

You'll need an Expo account to use EAS Build. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).

Log in to your Expo account through the CLI:

```bash
npx expo login
```

### Step 5: Initialize EAS Project

Initialize your project with EAS (Expo Application Services):

```bash
npx eas init
```

This will connect your local project to Expo's cloud services and prepare it for building.

### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

The boilerplate uses environment variables for sensitive information. Create an `.env` file in your project root:

```
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Additional variables as needed
```

Then set up your EAS secrets for secure deployment:

```bash
npx eas secret:create --scope project --name SUPABASE_URL --value your_supabase_url
npx eas secret:create --scope project --name SUPABASE_ANON_KEY --value your_supabase_anon_key
# Add other secrets as needed
```

### Step 7: Configure EAS Build Profiles

The boilerplate includes pre-configured EAS build profiles in the `eas.json` file. Review and modify them as needed for your specific requirements.

For example:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "development"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "staging"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Next Steps

Now that your project is set up, you'll need to create a development build to start working with the app on your physical device or simulator.

Continue to the [Development Build](/quickstart/development-build) guide to learn how to build and run your app in development mode.
