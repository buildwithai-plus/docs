## Boilerplate Setup

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your BuildWithAI boilerplate from scratch, from cloning the repository to configuring your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

**Required Software** (skip if you already have them):
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v16 or later) - [Need help installing? →](/quickstart/setup-nodejs)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - [Need help installing? →](/quickstart/setup-git)
- [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.com/download/editor) - [Need help installing? →](/quickstart/setup-windsurf)

**Required Account:**
- [Expo Account](https://expo.dev/signup) - Create a free account - [Need help? →](/quickstart/setup-expo-account)

### Step 1: Create Your Project

1. Open [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.com/download/editor)
2. Click the "Open Folder" button
3. Create a new empty folder for your project
4. Select this folder and click "Open"

### Step 2: Get the Boilerplate code

1. Open the terminal in Windsurf by pressing:
   - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+\`` (backtick)
   - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+\` (backtick)

2. Copy this command, paste it in the terminal, and press Enter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steffensunbranch/buildwithai-boilerplate.git .
```

3. Copy this command, paste it in the terminal, and press Enter:

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Copy this command, paste it in the terminal, and press Enter:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all the packages your app needs. It may take a few minutes.

### Step 4: Create Environment Variables File

Your boilerplate includes an example environment file (`.env.example`) with placeholders for various services. You need to create your own copy of this file called `.env`.

Copy this command, paste it in the terminal, and press Enter:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This creates a new file called `.env` that is a copy of `.env.example`. You'll add your actual API keys and settings to this `.env` file later.

<Info>
  You'll configure specific environment variables as you set up various features in the following guides.
