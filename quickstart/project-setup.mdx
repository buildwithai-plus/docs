    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Project">
    1. Open **Windsurf IDE**
    2. Click the **Open Folder** button
    3. Create a new empty folder for your project
    4. Select the folder and click **Open**

    <Tip>
      Give your folder a descriptive name related to your app
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the Boilerplate">
    Open the terminal in Windsurf IDE:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        Press **Ctrl\+Shift\+** (backtick)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        Press **Cmd\+Shift\+** (backtick)
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    Run this command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/steffensunbranch/buildwithai-boilerplate.git .
    ```

    Then remove the origin link:

    ```bash
    git remote remove origin
    ```

    <Warning>
      Don't forget the period at the end of the clone command. It ensures files are cloned directly into your current folder.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    In the same terminal, run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    <Info>
      This will download and install all required packages. It may take several minutes to complete.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Environment Variables">
    Create your environment file by copying the example:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    <Accordion title="What are environment variables?">
      Environment variables store configuration settings that may change between environments (development, staging, production).

      Your .env file will store API keys, service URLs, and other configuration values that should not be committed to source control.

      You'll add specific values as you follow the next guides in this documentation.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up the boilerplate, you should [configure your app settings](/quickstart/app-configuration) to customize it for your specific project.
