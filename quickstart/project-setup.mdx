## Project Setup

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your BuildWithAI+ project from scratch, from cloning the repository to configuring your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v16 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.com/download/editor)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the BuildWithAI+ repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buildwithai-plus/boilerplate.git your-app-name
cd your-app-name
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Your App

The boilerplate comes with an example configuration file. Start by renaming it to `app.json`:

```bash
cp app.json.example app.json
```

Now, open the `app.json` file and update the following essential fields to customize your app:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "scheme": "your-app-scheme",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  The boilerplate includes many more configuration options, but these are the essential fields you need to update before starting development.
</Tip>

#### Essential fields to update:

- **name**: The display name of your app as it will appear on users' devices
- **slug**: A unique identifier for your project (use lowercase, no spaces, and hyphens) - this is used in URLs and other places
- **scheme**: A URL scheme for deep linking (use something unique to your app, e.g., "myawesomeapp")
- **bundleIdentifier** (iOS): Your app's unique identifier in reverse domain format (e.g., "com.yourcompany.yourapp")
- **package** (Android): Your app's unique identifier in reverse domain format (should match your iOS bundleIdentifier)

#### App Icons and Splash Screens

The boilerplate includes custom branded icons and splash screens in the `assets/images/` directory.

<Info>
  Replace these with your own assets before publishing. For detailed instructions, see our [App Icons Guide](/features/customization/app-icons).
</Info>

### Step 4: Log in to Expo

You'll need an Expo account to use EAS Build. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).

Log in to your Expo account through the CLI:

```bash
eas login
```

Check if you are logged in:
```bash
eas whoami
```


### Step 5: Initialize EAS Project

Initialize your project with EAS (Expo Application Services):

```bash
eas init
```

This will connect your local project to Expo's cloud services and prepare it for building.

### Step 6: Configure Basic Environment

The boilerplate includes an example environment file with placeholders for various services:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

<Info>
  You'll configure specific environment variables as you set up various features. For authentication setup, see the [Supabase Setup Guide](/features/auth/supabase-setup).
</Info>

### Step 7: Configure EAS Build Profiles

The boilerplate includes pre-configured EAS build profiles in the `eas.json` file. Review and modify them as needed for your specific requirements.

For example:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "development"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "staging"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Next Steps

**1. Set up Authentication with Supabase**

Before creating development builds, you'll need to set up authentication with Supabase:

- Continue to the [Supabase Setup Guide](/features/auth/supabase-setup) to configure your authentication backend.

**2. Create a Development Build**

After setting up Supabase, create a development build to start working with the app on your device:

- Follow the [Development Build](/quickstart/development-build) guide to build and run your app in development mode.
