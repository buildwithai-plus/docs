<Note>
  This guide sets up Sentry via the official AI wizard. The wizard automatically configures your app with all necessary error tracking settings.
</Note>

## Step 1: Run the Sentry Wizard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch the wizard">
    In your project root directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx @sentry/wizard --integration reactNative
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your account">
    During the wizard setup:
    - Choose <b>Sign up</b> if you don't have a Sentry account yet
    - If you already have an account, choose <b>Log in</b>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your platforms">
    Use arrow keys to navigate and press <b>spacebar</b> to select which platforms you want to set up (iOS, Android, or both).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  The wizard will install dependencies and update the relevant files, configuring Sentry error tracking in your codebase.
</Check>

## Step 2: Test the Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Follow the implementation instructions in the `integrations/sentry/README.md` file included in your boilerplate codebase. This file contains all necessary steps for testing Sentry in your application, including the test button component.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the integration">
    Once you've followed the README instructions:
    1. Restart your app
    2. Use the test Sentry button component as described in the README
    3. Log in to your Sentry dashboard
    4. Go to the <b>Issues</b> section
    5. Confirm that your test errors appear in the dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Configuration

To verify that Sentry is working correctly:

1. **Test Error Reporting**: Use the test button to generate a test error
2. **Check Dashboard**: Verify the error appears in your Sentry dashboard
3. **Test Different Error Types**: Try different types of errors (JavaScript, native, etc.)
4. **Verify Environment**: Ensure errors are tagged with the correct environment (development, production)
