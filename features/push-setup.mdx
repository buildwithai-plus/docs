This guide shows you how to set up push notifications in your app. The boilerplate includes all the necessary code structure, but platform-specific setup is required, particularly for Android devices.

**Important Note:** 
- Android push notifications are **disabled by default** until you complete the setup process in this guide.
- iOS push notifications are already enabled if you selected "yes" to enabling push notifications during your first development build.

## Step 1: Service Setup

Before implementing push notifications in your app, you need to set up the necessary services for each platform:

    <Tip>
      Android push notifications are disabled by default in the boilerplate. Follow this guide to enable them for your app.

    - [FCM Credentials Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/fcm-credentials/)
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Firebase Project">
        1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
        2. Click "Add project" (or use an existing project for your app)
        3. Follow the prompts to create and configure your project
      </Step>

      <Step title="Generate Service Account Key">
        1. In the Firebase console, open Project settings > Service accounts
        2. Click "Generate New Private Key", then confirm by clicking "Generate Key"
        3. Securely store the downloaded JSON file containing the private key
      </Step>

      <Step title="Upload Service Account Key to EAS">
        **Using EAS Dashboard**
        1. Go to your [Expo project dashboard](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project])
        2. Pick your account and project
        3. Scroll down to **Credentials** under **Project settings** in the menu on the left
        4. Under **Android**, find your **Android Application Identifier** - your package name from `app.json`
        5. Click on it
        6. Under **Service Credentials > FCM V1 service account key**, click **Add a service account key**
        7. Under **Upload new key**, upload your JSON credential file and click **Save**

        > **Note:** Copy your **SHA-1 fingerprint** from the **Android upload keystore** table
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add Android App to Firebase & Download Configuration File">
        1. In the Firebase Console, go to your project and click **Add app** and select **Android**
           - Enter your Android package name (found in your `app.json`)
           - For the App nickname, you can use your app name
           - Paste your **SHA-1 fingerprint** from the **Android upload keystore** table from the last step
           - Register the app and download the `google-services.json` file
        
        2. **Save the `google-services.json` file**
           - Put it in your project's main folder (where your `package.json` or `app.json` files are)
        
        2. **Just skip the rest of the flow in Firebase**
           - Skip **Add Firebase SDK** and **Next steps**
        
        > **Note:** This is a sensitive file that should not be tracked by git. Make sure it is added to your `.gitignore` file, but not in the `.easignore` file.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="iOS Setup (APNs)">
    <Tip>
      iOS push notifications are already enabled if you selected "yes" during your initial [development build](/quickstart/development-build.mdx). If you skipped this setup, follow these instructions to add push notification support later.
    </Tip>

    <Accordion title="Adding Push Notifications After Initial Build">
      1. **Run the EAS credentials command:**
         ```sh
         eas credentials --platform ios
         ```
         - Choose `Push Notifications: Manage your Apple Push Notifications Key`.
         - Follow the prompts to add or generate a new push notification key for your project.
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Implementation

Follow the implementation instructions in the `integrations/push/README.md` file included in your boilerplate codebase. This file contains all necessary steps for integrating push notifications in your application, including:

- Code configuration and uncommenting
- Integration of the `google-services.json` file 
- Required app.json settings
- Build instructions

## Step 3: Testing Notifications

The boilerplate includes a built-in notifications demo that makes testing easy:

1. Open your development build
2. Navigate to the `Account` tab 
3. Select `Notifications` settings
4. Tap on `Test Push Notifications`
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to send and receive test notifications
