# Push Notifications Setup

The BuildWithAI boilerplate includes a comprehensive push notification system powered by Expo's notification services. This guide will walk you through the setup process for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Overview

The push notification system in the boilerplate handles:

- Requesting and storing push notification permissions
- Registering and managing device tokens
- Handling incoming notifications (foreground, background, and when app is closed)
- Displaying notification UI and handling user interactions

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A BuildWithAI boilerplate project set up
- An Expo account (if you don't have one, [sign up here](https://expo.dev/signup))
- Apple Developer account (for iOS push notifications)
- Firebase project (for Android push notifications)

## Step 1: Configure Expo Push Tokens

The boilerplate provides a hook for managing push tokens:

```jsx
// src/hooks/useNotifications.ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import * as Device from 'expo-device';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';

export function useNotifications(userId: string | null) {
  useEffect(() => {
    registerForPushNotifications(userId);
  }, [userId]);

  // Implementation details...
}
```

Make sure your app's backend API is set up to receive and store these tokens. The boilerplate uses Supabase to store device tokens.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS Setup (APNs)">
    <Note>
      The easiest way to set up iOS push notifications is during your initial development build process as described in the [Development Build Guide](/quickstart/development-build.mdx).
    </Note>

    <Info>
      A paid Apple Developer Account is required for iOS push notifications.
    </Info>

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Adding Push Notifications After Initial Build">
        <Tip>
          If you skipped push notification setup during your initial development build or answered "no" to the prompts, follow these instructions to add push notification support later.
        </Tip>

        1. **Run the EAS credentials command:**
           ```sh
           eas credentials --platform ios
           ```
           - Choose `Push Notifications: Manage your Apple Push Notifications Key`.
           - Follow the prompts to add or generate a new push notification key for your project.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Documentation references:**
    - [Expo Push Notifications Setup](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup/)
    - [FCM Credentials Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/fcm-credentials/)

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Firebase Project">
        1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
        2. Click "Add project" (or use an existing project for your app)
        3. Follow the prompts to create and configure your project
      </Step>

      <Step title="Generate Service Account Key">
        1. In the Firebase console, open Project settings > Service accounts
        2. Click "Generate New Private Key", then confirm by clicking "Generate Key"
        3. Securely store the downloaded JSON file containing the private key
      </Step>

      <Step title="Upload Service Account Key to EAS">
        **Using EAS Dashboard**
        1. Go to your [Expo project dashboard](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project])
        2. Pick your account and project
        3. Scroll down to **Credentials** under **Project settings** in the menu on the left
        4. Under **Android**, find your **Android Application Identifier** - your package name from `app.json`
        5. Click on it
        6. Under **Service Credentials > FCM V1 service account key**, click **Add a service account key**
        7. Under **Upload new key**, upload your JSON credential file and click **Save**

        > **Note:** Copy your **SHA-1 fingerprint** from the **Android upload keystore** table
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add Android App to Firebase and Configure google-services.json">
        1. In the Firebase Console, go to your project and click **Add app** and select **Android**
           - Enter your Android package name (found in your `app.json`)
           - For the App nickname, you can use your app name
           - Paste your **SHA-1 fingerprint** from the **Android upload keystore** table from the last step
           - Register the app and download the `google-services.json` file
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set up the downloaded file in your project">
        1. **Save the `google-services.json` file**
           - Put it in your project's main folder (where your `package.json` or `app.json` files are)

        2. **Tell Expo where to find the file by adding this to your `app.json`:**
           ```json
           {
             "expo": {
               "android": {
                 "package": "com.yourcompany.yourappname",
                 "versionCode": 1,
                 "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
               }
             }
           }
           ```

        > **Note:** This is a sensitive file that should not be tracked by git. But, EAS needs it to build the app. So:
        > - Make sure it is added to the `.gitignore` file
        > - But not in the `.easignore` file

        > **Note:** Just skip the rest of the flow in Firebase (*Add Firebase SDK* and *Next steps*)
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Rebuild Your App

After setting up push notification credentials for either platform, you need to create a new development build with these credentials:

```bash
eas build --profile development
```

Pick your platform (ios, android, or all) and wait for the build to finish.

Once the build is complete, install it on your device to test the push notification functionality.

## Step 4: Test Push Notifications

<Info>
  Your app includes a built-in demo screen for testing push notifications.  
</Info>

1. Open your development build
2. Navigate to the `Account` tab
3. Select `Notifications` settings
4. Tap on `Test Push Notifications`
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to send and receive test notifications
