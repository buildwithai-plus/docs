This guide shows you how to quickly enable push notifications in your app. The boilerplate already includes all the necessary code - you just need to uncomment a few lines and configure your services.

## Step 1: Enable Push Notifications in Your Code

The boilerplate includes a ready-to-use notification system that just needs to be enabled:

1. Open `lib/notifications/useNotification.ts`
2. Find the code block with `// TODO: Android - Uncomment to enable Android push notifications`
3. Uncomment the code block (remove the `/*` at the beginning and `*/` at the end)

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

    <Tip>
      If you skipped push notification setup during your initial [development build](/quickstart/development-build.mdx) by answering "no" to the prompt, follow these instructions to add push notification support.
    </Tip>

    <Accordion title="Adding Push Notifications After Initial Build">
      1. **Run the EAS credentials command:**
         ```sh
         eas credentials --platform ios
         ```
         - Choose `Push Notifications: Manage your Apple Push Notifications Key`.
         - Follow the prompts to add or generate a new push notification key for your project.
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Android Setup (FCM)">

    - [FCM Credentials Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/fcm-credentials/)

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Firebase Project">
        1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
        2. Click "Add project" (or use an existing project for your app)
        3. Follow the prompts to create and configure your project
      </Step>

      <Step title="Generate Service Account Key">
        1. In the Firebase console, open Project settings > Service accounts
        2. Click "Generate New Private Key", then confirm by clicking "Generate Key"
        3. Securely store the downloaded JSON file containing the private key
      </Step>

      <Step title="Upload Service Account Key to EAS">
        **Using EAS Dashboard**
        1. Go to your [Expo project dashboard](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project])
        2. Pick your account and project
        3. Scroll down to **Credentials** under **Project settings** in the menu on the left
        4. Under **Android**, find your **Android Application Identifier** - your package name from `app.json`
        5. Click on it
        6. Under **Service Credentials > FCM V1 service account key**, click **Add a service account key**
        7. Under **Upload new key**, upload your JSON credential file and click **Save**

        > **Note:** Copy your **SHA-1 fingerprint** from the **Android upload keystore** table
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add Android App to Firebase and Configure google-services.json">
        1. In the Firebase Console, go to your project and click **Add app** and select **Android**
           - Enter your Android package name (found in your `app.json`)
           - For the App nickname, you can use your app name
           - Paste your **SHA-1 fingerprint** from the **Android upload keystore** table from the last step
           - Register the app and download the `google-services.json` file
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set up the downloaded file in your project">
        1. **Save the `google-services.json` file**
           - Put it in your project's main folder (where your `package.json` or `app.json` files are)

        2. **Tell Expo where to find the file by adding this to your `app.json`:**
           ```json
           {
             "expo": {
               "android": {
                 "package": "com.yourcompany.yourappname",
                 "versionCode": 1,
                 "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
               }
             }
           }
           ```

        > **Note:** This is a sensitive file that should not be tracked by git. But, EAS needs it to build the app. So:
        > - Make sure it is added to the `.gitignore` file
        > - But not in the `.easignore` file

        > **Note:** Just skip the rest of the flow in Firebase (*Add Firebase SDK* and *Next steps*)
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Rebuild Your App

After setting up push notification credentials for either platform, you need to create a new development build with these credentials:

```bash
eas build --profile development
```

Pick your platform (ios, android, or all) and wait for the build to finish.

Once the build is complete, install it on your device to test the push notification functionality.

## Step 4: Testing Notifications

The boilerplate includes a built-in notifications demo that makes testing easy:

1. Open your development build
2. Navigate to the `Account` tab 
3. Select `Notifications` settings
4. Tap on `Test Push Notifications`
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to send and receive test notifications
