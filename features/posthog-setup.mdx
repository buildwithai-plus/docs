This boilerplate comes with built-in support for PostHog analytics, helping you understand how users interact with your app. Let's set it up!

<Steps>

### Create a PostHog Account
Go to the [PostHog website](https://us.posthog.com/signup) and create an account.

At the top of the signup page, you'll need to choose a **Data Region**:

- **US hosting** (Virginia, USA)
  - Faster if you and your users are based in the US
  - Easier to comply with some US regulations

- **EU hosting** (Frankfurt, Germany)
  - Faster if you and your users are based in Europe
  - Keeps data in the EU to comply with GDPR requirements

You can migrate to another region later if needed.

### Select Product Analytics
On the welcome screen, click the **Product Analytics** button.

This will take you to the onboarding process for setting up analytics in your project.

### Choose React Native Integration
In the installation screen, select **React Native** as your source type from the menu on the left.

You'll see integration instructions specifically for React Native applications.

### Copy Your API Key and Host
From the [PostHog Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings), locate and copy your:
- API Key (looks like `phc_XXXXXXXXXX...`) 
- Host URL (Depending on your Data Region, `https://us.i.posthog.com` or `https://eu.i.posthog.com`)

You'll need these values to configure your application.

### Configure Environment Variables
Add your PostHog API key and host to your environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY=your-posthog-api-key-here
EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=your-posthog-host-here
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the PostHog React Native package and its required dependencies:

```bash
npx expo install posthog-react-native expo-file-system expo-application expo-device expo-localization
```

### Enable PostHog
The boilerplate already includes code for PostHog analytics, but it's commented out by default.
Uncomment all code blocks marked with `TODO: PostHog` in `app/_layout.tsx`:

- The PostHog imports
- The PostHog provider wrapper around your app

### Track Events
Once enabled, you can track events in your app using the PostHog hook:

```typescript
import { usePostHog } from 'posthog-react-native';

function MyComponent() {
  const posthog = usePostHog();
  
  const handleButtonPress = () => {
    // Track a custom event
    posthog.capture('button_pressed', {
      buttonName: 'signup',
      userType: 'new'
    });
    
    // Rest of your handler logic
  };
  
  return (
    <Button onPress={handleButtonPress} title="Sign Up" />
  );
}
```

### Track Screen Views
For automatic screen tracking with Expo Router, consider adding middleware to track screen views.

This allows you to track user navigation throughout your app automatically.
