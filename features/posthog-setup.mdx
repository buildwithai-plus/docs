title: "Track User Analytics"
description: "Add powerful analytics to your app with PostHog integration"
---

This boilerplate comes with built-in support for PostHog analytics, helping you understand how users interact with your app. Let's set it up!

## Step 1: Create and Configure PostHog Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a PostHog Account">
    Go to the [PostHog website](https://us.posthog.com/signup) and create an account.

    At the top of the signup page, you'll need to choose a **Data Region**:

    - **US hosting** (Virginia, USA)
      - Faster if you and your users are based in the US
      - Easier to comply with some US regulations

    - **EU hosting** (Frankfurt, Germany)
      - Faster if you and your users are based in Europe
      - Keeps data in the EU to comply with GDPR requirements

    You can migrate to another region later if needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Product Analytics">
    On the welcome screen, click the **Product Analytics** button.

    This will take you to the onboarding process for setting up analytics in your project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose React Native Integration">
    In the installation screen, select **React Native** as your source type from the menu on the left.

    You'll see integration instructions specifically for React Native applications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Get API Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy Your API Key and Host">
    From the [PostHog Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings), locate and copy your:
    - API Key (looks like `phc_XXXXXXXXXX...`) 
    - Host URL (Depending on your Data Region, `https://us.i.posthog.com` or `https://eu.i.posthog.com`)

    You'll need these values to configure your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Configure Your Application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Add your PostHog API key and host to your environment variables in `.env`:

    ```bash
    EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY=your-posthog-api-key-here
    EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=your-posthog-host-here
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Install the PostHog React Native package and its required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npx expo install posthog-react-native expo-file-system expo-application expo-device expo-localization
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable PostHog">
    The boilerplate already includes code for PostHog analytics, but it's commented out by default.
    Uncomment all code blocks marked with `TODO: PostHog` in `app/_layout.tsx`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Track User Events

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implement Event Tracking">
    Once enabled, you can track events in your app using the PostHog hook:

    ```typescript
    import { usePostHog } from 'posthog-react-native';

    function MyComponent() {
      const posthog = usePostHog();
      
      const handleButtonPress = () => {
        // Track a custom event
        posthog.capture('button_pressed', {
          buttonName: 'signup',
          userType: 'new'
        });
        
        // Rest of your handler logic
      };
      
      return (
        <Button onPress={handleButtonPress} title="Sign Up" />
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps
