# PostHog Analytics

This boilerplate comes with built-in support for PostHog analytics, which has been modularized for simplicity.

## Setup Instructions

<Step title="Create a PostHog Account">
  Go to the [PostHog website](https://us.posthog.com/signup) and create an account.
  
  At the top of the signup page, you'll need to choose a **Data Region**:
  
  - **US hosting** (Virginia, USA)
    - Faster if you and your users are based in the US
    - Easier to comply with some US regulations
  
  - **EU hosting** (Frankfurt, Germany)
    - Faster if you and your users are based in Europe
    - Keeps data in the EU to comply with GDPR requirements
  
  You can migrate to another region later if needed.
  
  After completing the signup flow, you'll see a welcome screen asking "Where do you want to start?"
</Step>

<Step title="Select Product Analytics">
  On the welcome screen, click the **Product Analytics** button.
  
  This will take you to the onboarding process for setting up analytics in your project.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose React Native Integration">
  In the installation screen, select **React Native** as your source type from the menu on the left.
  
  You'll see integration instructions specifically for React Native applications.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy Your API Key and Host">
  From the [PostHog Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings), locate and copy your:
  - API Key (looks like `phc_XXXXXXXXXX...`) 
  - Host URL (Depending on your Data Region, `https://us.i.posthog.com` or `https://eu.i.posthog.com`)
  
  You'll need these values to configure your application.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure environment variables">
  Add your PostHog API key and host to your environment variables in `.env`:
  
  ```
  EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY=your-posthog-api-key-here
  EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=your-posthog-host-here
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Install the dependency">
  Install the PostHog React Native package:

  ```bash
  npx expo install posthog-react-native expo-file-system expo-application expo-device expo-localization
  ```
</Step>


<Step title="Uncomment PostHog Code">
  The boilerplate already includes code for PostHog analytics, but it's commented out by default.
  Uncomment all code blocks marked with `TODO: PostHog` in this file:
  
  - `app/_layout.tsx`
  
  You'll need to uncomment:
  - The PostHog imports
  - The PostHog provider wrapper around your app
</Step>

<Step title="Using PostHog for Event Tracking">
  Once enabled, you can track events in your app using the PostHog hook. Here's an example:

  ```typescript
  import { usePostHog } from 'posthog-react-native';

  function MyComponent() {
    const posthog = usePostHog();
    
    const handleButtonPress = () => {
      // Track a custom event
      posthog.capture('button_pressed', {
        buttonName: 'signup',
        userType: 'new'
      });
      
      // Rest of your handler logic
    };
    
    return (
      <Button onPress={handleButtonPress} title="Sign Up" />
    );
  }
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Screen Tracking">
  For automatic screen tracking with Expo Router, consider adding middleware to track screen views.
  
  This allows you to track user navigation throughout your app automatically.
</Step>
