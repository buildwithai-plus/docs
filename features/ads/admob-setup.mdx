# AdMob Integration

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Add monetization to your app only after you've published it to the app stores. Implementing ads too early in your development process can lead to account issues with Google AdMob.
</Callout>

## When to Add AdMob

The BuildWithAI boilerplate comes with AdMob integration ready to be enabled, but we recommend following this timeline:

1. First develop and test your core app functionality
2. Publish your app to App Store and Google Play
3. Then set up AdMob and implement monetization

This approach ensures your account remains in good standing with ad networks and provides a better user experience.

## Setup Process Overview

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Create AdMob Account
    
    Sign up for an AdMob account at [admob.google.com](https://admob.google.com/) if you don't already have one.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Register Your App in AdMob
    
    In the AdMob console:
    - Click "Apps" in the left sidebar, then "Add app"
    - Select platform (iOS or Android)
    - When asked "Is the app listed on a supported app store?" select "Yes"
    - Enter your app's store information
  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Ad Units

<Callout type="info">
  When testing your app, always use test ad units. Using production ad units during development can lead to account suspension.
</Callout>

After your app is published to the app stores:

1. In AdMob console, click "Add ad unit"
2. Configure your ad unit:
   - Select ad format (Banner, Interstitial, etc.)
   - Name your ad unit (e.g., "Main Screen Banner")
   - Leave partner bidding unchecked for simplicity
3. Click "Create ad unit" and copy the generated ad unit ID

## Configuring Production Ad Units

After your app is published and you have created ad units:

1. Go to the Expo dashboard: [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/)
2. Navigate to your project's environment variables: 
   `https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/environment-variables/new`
3. Add the following variables (production only):

```bash filename="Production Environment Variables"
EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_BANNER_ANDROID=ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxx
EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_BANNER_IOS=ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxx
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Only enable these variables for Production builds. Make sure "Preview" and "Development" environments are unchecked.
</Callout>
