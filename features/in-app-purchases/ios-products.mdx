Under Monetization, select '**Subscriptions**'

### Bonus: Trial Period

Create a new subscription product the same way as explained above, but now with a trial period.

Let's say I want a yearly subscription with a 1 week trial period: 

`bwai_premium_1y_1w` (this is the product ID from above, but with _1w added at the end)

Inside your subscription product, you can add a trial period. This is a period during which users can try your subscription for free before being charged. 

To add a trial period, go to the subscription product you want to add a trial period to.

Under "Subscription Prices" click the **+** > **Create Introductory Offer**
- Countries or Regions for Introductory Offer: Select **All** and scroll down and click **Next**

    - Pick **Free**
        - Duration: Pick your duration (e.g. 1 week)
    - Click **Next**

Scroll down and click **Confirm** to confirm the introductory offer.


### Done

Now, click **Save** to finish setting up your subscription product.

Your subscription product should have status as **Ready to submit**

This means you can now add it to your app!
