    - **Tax and Banking:** Complete forms in the "Tax" and "Banking" tabs
    - **Bank Account:** Linked with "Clear" status
    
    **You cannot test in-app purchases until these requirements are met.**

</Steps>

## Enable In-App Purchases for Your App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure App Settings">
    1. Select your app from the list in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps)
    2. Under **App Information**, ensure "In-App Purchases" is enabled
    3. If not enabled:
       - Click the **Edit** button
       - Check the box next to "In-App Purchases"
       - Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure Your Expo Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Required Packages">
    1. Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npx expo install expo-superwall react-native-purchases expo-build-properties
    ```

    2. Add the expo plugin to your `app.json`:
    ```json
    [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "16.0"
          },
          "android": {
            "minSdkVersion": 26
          }
        }
    ]
    ```

    This installs the necessary packages and configures your project with the minimum SDK versions required for in-app purchases.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create EAS Build">
    1. Build your app:
    ```bash
    eas build -p ios --profile development
    ```

    2. When the build completes, install it on your device to prepare for testing in-app purchases
  </Step>
</Steps>
