## Prerequisites

Before setting up your app in App Store Connect, make sure you have:

- An Apple Developer account with paid enrollment
- Your app's bundle ID ready (from `app.json`)
- Access to create and manage apps in App Store Connect

## Add iOS App to App Store Connect

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recommended: Create App entry via EAS (auto-submit)">
    This uses one iOS build, but it's usually worth it since EAS creates the App Store record for you and uploads the build.

    1. Run:
    ```bash
    eas build -p ios --profile production --auto-submit
    ```

    2. Sign in when prompted:
       - Enter your Apple ID email and password, then choose the correct team.

    3. What it does:
       - Builds your iOS app in the cloud, creates the App Store record if missing, uploads the build, and submits it to TestFlight.
       - It is NOT submitted to the App Store for review.

    4. Track progress:
       - Open the dashboard link printed in your terminal to follow the build and processing.

    5. Why now:
       - Makes the app available in App Store Connect so we can add inâ€‘app purchases next. It uses one build, but is usually worth it.

    <Note>
    After the build and submission finish, your app should appear here: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps
    
    If you see errors in the terminal or on the EAS links (build/submission), open the link, copy the logs, and paste them to your AI assistant (Cursor / Claude Code / Windsurf) with a note like: "EAS iOS build or submission failed" plus the logs.
