## What Is Sandbox Testing?

Sandbox testing lets you test in-app purchases without using real money. It's an essential step before launching your app.

## Create a Sandbox Account

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Navigate to **Users and Access > Sandbox Testers**
3. Click the **+** button
4. Enter your email address (must be verifiable) You could for instance just use your email with "sandbox" in it (e.g. "steffen+sandbox@buildwithai.io")
5. Fill in the required fields and select a region
6. Click **Save**

## Testing on Your Device

### Step 1: Install Your App

Install your development build on your iOS device.

### Step 2: Add Sandbox Account to Settings

Add your sandbox account on the device so it's ready when you integrate purchases:

- iOS 13-17: **Settings > App Store > Sandbox Account**
- iOS 18+: **Settings > Developer > Sandbox Apple Account**

## Important Things to Know

### Subscription Testing

Subscription renewals are accelerated in sandbox mode:

| Real Subscription | Sandbox Renewal |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 month           | 5 minutes      |
| 1 year            | 1 hour         |

### Common Issues

- **Slow response:** Sandbox purchases may take up to 15 seconds. This is normal.
- **Price differences:** Prices may not match what you set in App Store Connect. Focus on testing the purchase flow, not the exact prices.

## Reset Your Testing Environment

### To test as a new user:

1. Uninstall and reinstall your app
2. Create a new sandbox account if needed

## TestFlight Testing

In TestFlight, all subscription renewals happen once per day regardless of the original duration.
