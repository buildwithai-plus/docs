    Your test accounts will receive purchase responses as if they were real purchases, allowing you to test the complete purchase flow.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create production build

Before proceeding to closed testing, you need to create a production build of your app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build for production">
    Build your app for production using EAS Build:
    
    ```bash
    eas build -p android --profile production
    ```
    
    <Info>
    This command creates a production-ready Android App Bundle (.aab) file that you'll upload to Google Play Console.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track build progress">
    Monitor your build progress using one of these methods:
    
    - Open the URL printed in the terminal, or
    - Visit the [EAS dashboard](https://expo.dev/accounts/[YOUR_ACCOUNT]/projects/[YOUR_PROJECT]/builds)
    - Select your newly created production build
    
    <Note>
    Production builds typically take 10-15 minutes to complete, depending on your app's complexity and current build queue.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download build artifacts">
    When the build completes:
    
    1. Under **Build artifacts**, click **Download** to get the **.aab** file
    2. Save the file to a secure location on your computer
    
    <Check>
    You now have a production-ready Android App Bundle that you can upload to Google Play Console for closed testing.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Keep your production build (.aab file) secure and don't share it publicly. This file contains your app's production configuration and should only be uploaded to Google Play Console.
