## Testing Your Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Update the API keys in your `.env` file:
    
    ```
    # Superwall API Keys
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPERWALL_API_KEY_IOS=your-superwall-ios-api-key
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPERWALL_API_KEY_ANDROID=your-superwall-android-api-key

    # RevenueCat API Keys
    EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS=your-revenuecat-ios-api-key
    EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_ANDROID=your-revenuecat-android-api-key
    ```
    
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys from RevenueCat and Superwall dashboards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rename Example Files">
    Rename the example files by running these commands in your project root:
    
    ```bash
    mv lib/iap/RCPurchaseController.tsx.example lib/iap/RCPurchaseController.tsx
    ```
    
    ```bash
    mv lib/iap/SuperwallDelegate.ts.example lib/iap/SuperwallDelegate.ts
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Example Campaign and Paywall">
    Before creating your own campaigns and paywalls, you can use the example campaign provided by Superwall:
    
    1. In the Superwall dashboard, navigate to **Campaigns** in the left sidebar
    2. Click on **Example Campaign**
    3. Select the **1 Paywall** tab
    4. Click on the paywall card, then click **Edit Paywall**
    5. In the paywall editor, select the **Products** tab in the left sidebar
    6. Configure your products:
       - Set your **Annual** subscription product as the primary product
       - Set your **Monthly** subscription product as the secondary product
       - Click **Save** when done
    
    You can trigger this paywall in your app using the `campaign_trigger` placement ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Google Play Products in Superwall">
    Add your previously created subscription products to Superwall one by one. You'll need to add both your annual and monthly subscription products separately.
    
    1. Navigate to **Products** > **Products** in the Superwall dashboard
    2. Click **+ Add Product**
    
    ### Adding Annual Subscription
    Fill in these fields for your annual subscription:
    
    - **Product ID**: Enter the exact Product ID from Google Play (e.g., `bwai_premium`)
    - **Base Plan ID**: Enter your annual base plan ID (e.g., `annual-autorenewing`)
    - **Automatically Pick Offer**: Toggle ON to let Superwall choose the best available offer
    - **Trial**: Select "None" unless you have a specific trial configuration
    - **Price**: Select the exact price from Google Play
    - **Period**: Select "Year"
    - **Entitlements**: Select the premium entitlement you created earlier
    - Click **Save** to add the product
    
    ### Adding Monthly Subscription
    Repeat the process for your monthly subscription:
    
    - **Product ID**: Enter the exact Product ID from Google Play (e.g., `bwai_premium`)
    - **Base Plan ID**: Enter your monthly base plan ID (e.g., `monthly-autorenewing`)
    - **Automatically Pick Offer**: Toggle ON
    - **Trial**: Select "None" unless you have a specific trial configuration
    - **Price**: Select the exact price from Google Play 
    - **Period**: Select "Month"
    - **Entitlements**: Select the same entitlement as the annual subscription
    - Click **Save** to add the product
    
    When "Automatically Pick Offer" is enabled, Superwall will choose the best offer available to the user, prioritizing the longest free trial the customer is eligible for, followed by the cheapest introductory price.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Uncomment Feature Code">
    The boilerplate already includes some code for showing paywalls, but it's commented out by default.
    Uncomment all code blocks marked with `TODO: IAP` in these files:
    
    - `app/_layout.tsx`
    - `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
    - `app/(tabs)/premium.tsx`
    
    Each file contains clear TODO comments marking the sections to uncomment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build and Test">
    After making these changes, re-run the EAS development build for your platform:
    
    ```bash
    # For iOS
    eas build --profile development --platform ios
    
    # For Android
    eas build --profile development --platform android
    ```
    
    Once the build completes, install it on your device to test the Superwall integration with RevenueCat.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've now completed the entire in-app purchase setup flow:

1. Set up your app in the platform stores ([Google Play Console](./google-play-console-setup), [App Store Connect](./app-store-connect-setup))
2. Created subscription products ([Android](./android-products), [iOS](./ios-products))
3. Configured testing environments ([Android closed testing](./closed-testing), [iOS sandbox](./ios-sandbox))
4. Set up [RevenueCat](./revenuecat) for subscription management
5. [Imported products](./import-products-rc) into RevenueCat
6. Configured Superwall for paywall management

From here, you can:

- Customize your paywalls and campaigns in Superwall
- Develop and refine your app's monetization strategy
- Run A/B tests for different paywall designs
- Monitor subscription analytics in RevenueCat and Superwall

For more information about implementing the subscription logic in your app code, refer to the [RevenueCat documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart) and [Superwall documentation](https://docs.superwall.com/docs).
