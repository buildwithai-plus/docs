To set up subscription products for Android devices, start by logging into [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console). Google Play Console is Google's central hub for managing app releases, testing, in-app purchases, and more.

This guide assumes basic knowledge of Google Play Console, as well as having an app set up and ready for adding in-app purchases.

## Create a Subscription

> **Info**: You'll need to have an APK uploaded before you can create in-app products. Check out our guide on [sandbox testing on Android](sandbox-android.md) for details on how to upload an APK and roll out a release on a closed test track.

To create a subscription, go to Google Play Console's 'All Applications' page and select your app from the list.

In the sidebar, select the **Products** dropdown, then choose **Subscriptions**.

After clicking Create, provide a couple pieces of metadata to Google:

| Metadata   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product ID | The product ID is a unique alphanumeric ID that is used for accessing your product in development and syncing with RevenueCat. After you use a Product ID for one product in Google Play Console, **it can't be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**. |
| Name       | A short name of the item, up to 55 characters. This will be displayed on your Google Play Store listing.                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Tips for creating robust product IDs

After you use a Product ID for one product in Google Play Console, **it can't be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**. It helps to be a little organized here from the beginning - we recommend using a consistent naming scheme across all of your product identifiers such as:

> **`<app>_<entitlement>_<version>`**

- **app:** Some prefix that will be unique to your app, since the same product ID cannot be used in any future apps you create.
- **entitlement**: A name for what the product provides access to, e.g., "premium"
- **version**: A version number

For example, using this format the identifier for your first subscription product that grants access to premium content would be:

> `rc_premium_v1`

### Create a base plan

For subscription products, you'll need to add a base plan. Base plans define a billing period, price, and renewal type for purchasing your subscription. Customers never purchase a subscription product directly, they always purchase a base plan of a subscription.

Click "Add base plan" and fill out the associated fields. Make sure to set a price, and click "Activate". Since Google introduced multiple base plans with Billing Client 5, it's good practice to be as clear as possible when naming your plans, such as: `<duration>-<renewaltype>`, eg. `annual-autorenewing`.

> RevenueCat Products map to Base Plans for Google Play subscriptions, since those are the products that customers can purchase. Newly set up products in RevenueCat follow the identifier format `<subscription_id>:<base-plan-id>`, whereas products that were set up before February 2023 follow the identifier format `<subscription_id>`.

### Offers

In addition to base plans, you can create offers for your subscriptions. Offers allow you to provide discounted pricing or free trials to attract new subscribers or re-engage lapsed subscribers.

> **Info**: Offers are a powerful tool for increasing subscription conversion rates. Consider creating introductory offers like free trials or discounted first-month pricing to encourage users to try your subscription.
