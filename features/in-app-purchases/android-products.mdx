## Prerequisites

Before creating subscription products, make sure you have:

- Your app uploaded and approved for testing

## Create a Subscription

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Subscriptions">
    1. Open your app's Google Play Console
    2. In the left sidebar, click **Monetize with Play** > **Products** > **Subscriptions**
    3. If you see "Your app doesn't have any subscriptions yet", complete the [Closed testing guide](./closed-testing) first
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Subscription">
    1. Click **Create subscription**
    2. Provide the following metadata:

    | Metadata   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
    | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Product ID | The product ID is a unique alphanumeric ID that is used for accessing your product. |
    | Name       | A short name of the item, up to 55 characters. This will be displayed on your Google Play Store listing. |
  </Step>
</Steps>

    ### Tips for creating robust product IDs

    After you use a Product ID for one product in Google Play Console, **it can't be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**. Use a consistent naming scheme:

    > **`<app>_<entitlement>`**

    - **app:** Some prefix that will be unique to your app
    - **entitlement**: A name for what the product provides access to, e.g., "premium"

    For example: `bwai_premium`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Base Plans">
    For subscription products, you'll need to add base plans. Base plans define billing period, price, and renewal type. Customers purchase base plans, not subscription products directly.

    Use clear naming like: `<duration>-<renewaltype>`, e.g., `annual-autorenewing`

    ### Annual Base Plan
    1. Inside your subscription, under "Base plans and offers" click **Add base plan**
    2. Configure the plan:
       - **Base plan ID:** `annual-autorenewing`
       - **Type:** `Auto-renewing`
       - **Billing period:** Set to `Yearly`
       - Keep other fields as default
    3. Set pricing:
       - Click **Set price**
       - Toggle all countries
       - Click **Set price**
       - Choose a common currency like USD and pick a price
       - Click **Update**
       - All countries will automatically get converted prices
       - Click **Save**

    ### Monthly Base Plan
    1. Create another base plan with:
       - **Base plan ID:** `monthly-autorenewing`
       - **Type:** `Auto-renewing`
       - **Billing period:** Set to `Monthly`
    2. Follow the same pricing steps as above
  </Step>
</Steps>

Great! You now have your subscription products set up with monthly and yearly base plans.
