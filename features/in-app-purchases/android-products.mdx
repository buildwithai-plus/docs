## Create a Subscription

Inside your app's Google Play Console.
In the left sidebar, click **Monetize with Play** > **Products** > **Subscriptions**
If you see the message: "Your app doesn't have any subscriptions yet": refer back to our [Closed testing guide](./closed-testing.mdx)

After clicking **Create subscription**, provide the following metadata to Google:

| Metadata   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product ID | The product ID is a unique alphanumeric ID that is used for accessing your product. |
| Name       | A short name of the item, up to 55 characters. This will be displayed on your Google Play Store listing. |

### Tips for creating robust product IDs

After you use a Product ID for one product in Google Play Console, **it can't be used again across any of your apps, even if the product is deleted**. It helps to be a little organized here from the beginning - we recommend using a consistent naming scheme across all of your product identifiers such as:

> **`<app>_<entitlement>`**

- **app:** Some prefix that will be unique to your app, since the same product ID cannot be used in any future apps you create.
- **entitlement**: A name for what the product provides access to, e.g., "premium"

For example, using this format the identifier for your first subscription product that grants access to premium content would be:

> `bwai_premium`


### Create a base plan

For subscription products, you'll need to add a base plan. Base plans define a billing period, price, and renewal type for purchasing your subscription. Customers never purchase a subscription product directly, they always purchase a base plan of a subscription.

It's good practice to be as clear as possible when naming your plans, such as: `<duration>-<renewaltype>`, eg. `annual-autorenewing`.


Inside the subscription you just created, under "Base plans and offers" click **Add base plan** 
Base plan ID: `annual-autorenewing`
Type: `Auto-renewing`:
    - Billing period: Set to `Yearly`
    - Keep the rest of the fields as is
Price and availability: 
    - Click **Set price**
        - Toggle all countries
        - Click **Set price**
            - Pick your price: Choose a common currency like USD and pick a price (this is only for the billing period you selected)
            - Click **Update**
        - All countries will now automatically get their prices converted to their local currency
    - Click **Save**


Do this for the monthly base plan as well:

Base plan ID: `monthly-autorenewing`
Type: `Auto-renewing`:
    - Billing period: Set to `Monthly`
    - Keep the rest of the fields as is
Price and availability: 
    - Click **Set price**
        - Toggle all countries
        - Click **Set price**
            - Pick your price: Choose a common currency like USD and pick a price (this is only for the billing period you selected)
            - Click **Update**
        - All countries will now automatically get their prices converted to their local currency
    - Click **Save**


Great! You now have your subscription products set up with monthly and yearly base plans.
