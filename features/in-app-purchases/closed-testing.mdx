## Open Closed testing in Google Play Console

Once you've completed the app setup, you can access **Closed testing** from:
- Your app's **Dashboard** page, or
- **Test and release** > **Testing** > **Closed testing** in the left sidebar

<Note>
  You're setting up a <strong>Closed testing</strong> release to prepare your app for in‑app purchases. This step is required to enable Google Play Billing and internal testing. It <strong>does not</strong> publish your app to production or make it publicly available. You'll ship a production release when you're ready.

## How Testers Join Your Closed Test

You can find the Opt-in URL in the closed track you created under **Testers** > **How testers join your test**:
- Join on Android
- Join on the web

Copy the URL and open it on your testing device (or any browser logged in with that testing user) to make the user a tester.

Opening the link will show a Google Play page with a **BECOME A TESTER** button. Press that button and your user will be able to make testing purchases on your testing device.

They will also be added as a tester in the closed testing track. You need 12 users testing your app for 14 days to be able to publish your app to the Play Store.
