## Prerequisites

Before setting up closed testing, make sure you have:

- A Google Play Console developer account
- Your app's package name ready (from `app.json`)
- Access to create and manage apps in Google Play Console

## Create your app in Google Play Console

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New App">
    1. Open [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/)
    2. Select **All apps** > **Create app**
    
    ### App Details
    - Select a default language and add your app name as it should appear on Google Play
    - Specify whether your application is an app or a game
    - Specify whether your application is free or paid
    - Add an email address for Play Store users to contact you
    
    ### Declarations
    - Acknowledge the "Developer Program Policies" and "US export laws" declarations
    - Accept the Play App Signing Terms of Service
    
    3. Click **Create app**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete App Setup">
    When the app is created, you'll be taken to the app's **Dashboard** page.

    1. Click **View tasks** in the **Finish setting up your app** section
    2. Complete all tasks in the checklist:

    **Let us know about the content of your app:**
    - Set privacy policy
    - App access
    - Ads
    - Content rating
    - Target audience
    - Data safety
    - Government apps
    - Financial features
    - Health

    **Manage how your app is organized and presented:**
    - Select an app category and provide contact details
    - Set up your store listing

    Once all tasks are completed, you can proceed to **Closed testing**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set Up Closed Testing

Once you've completed the app setup, you can access **Closed testing** from:
- Your app's **Dashboard** page, or
- **Test and release** > **Testing** > **Closed testing** in the left sidebar

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Billing in Your Project">
    To enable billing functionality in your Expo/React Native project:

    1. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    npx expo install expo-superwall react-native-purchases expo-build-properties
    ```

    2. Add the expo plugin to your `app.json`:
    ```json
    [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "16.0"
          },
          "android": {
            "minSdkVersion": 26
          }
        }
    ]
    ```

    This will install the necessary packages and configure your project with the minimum SDK versions required for in-app purchases. These packages will automatically add the necessary `BILLING` permission to your Android app.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create EAS Production Build">
    1. Build your app for production:
    ```bash
    eas build -p android --profile production
    ```

    2. Track the build progress:
       - Open the URL printed in the terminal, or
       - Visit the [EAS dashboard](https://expo.dev/accounts/[YOUR_ACCOUNT]/projects/[YOUR_PROJECT]/builds)
       - Select your newly created production build

    3. When the build completes:
       - Under **Build artifacts**, click **Download** to get the **.aab** file
       - This file will be used to upload to Google Play Console
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Closed Test Track">
    1. Navigate to the **Closed testing** section in Google Play Console
    2. You'll see a pre-created **Closed testing - Alpha** track
    3. Click **Manage track** on this track

    ### Select Countries

       - **Add email addresses:** Add your testing email address (the one you're signed in with on your testing device)
       - Add any other email addresses you want to test with
       - Click **Save changes**
    2. Enable the list you just created
    3. **Feedback URL or email address:** Add your email address for feedback
    4. Click **Save**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and Release Your Build">
    ### Upload Your Build
    1. **App bundles:** Click **Upload** and select the Android App Bundle (.aab file) from the previous step
    2. **Release name:** Name it (e.g., "First Test release")
    3. **Release notes:** (Optional) Add release notes inside the `<en-US></en-US>` tags
    4. Click **Next**

    ### Preview and Confirm
    1. Review the release preview
    2. If everything looks good, click **Save**
    3. When the **Go to Publishing Overview** alert appears, click **Go to overview**

    ### Send for Review
    1. Google will run automatic checks for common issues
    2. If there are issues: View and fix them, then return to **Overview**
    3. If no issues: Click **Send X change(s) for review**
    4. Confirm by clicking **Send changes for review**
    
    Reviews are typically completed within 7 days, but small releases are usually approved within a day.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure License Testing">
    To test in-app purchases, you need to configure license testing:

    1. Open [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/)
    2. In the sidebar, click **Settings**
    3. Scroll down to find **License testing** under **Monetization** and click it
    4. **Choose license testers:** Use the testers list you created in the closed testing track
    5. Make sure the account you're using on your Android testing device is added to the testers list
    6. **License response:** Select **RESPOND_NORMALLY**
    7. Click **Save changes**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Testers Join Your Closed Test

You can find the Opt-in URL in the closed track you created under **Testers** > **How testers join your test**:
- Join on Android
- Join on the web

Copy the URL and open it on your testing device (or any browser logged in with that testing user) to make the user a tester.

Opening the link will show a Google Play page with a **BECOME A TESTER** button. Press that button and your user will be able to make testing purchases on your testing device.

They will also be added as a tester in the closed testing track. You need 12 users testing your app for 14 days to be able to publish your app to the Play Store.
