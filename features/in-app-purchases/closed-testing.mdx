## Access closed testing in Google Play Console

Once you've completed the app setup, you can access **Closed testing** from:
- Your app's **Dashboard** page, or
- **Test and release** > **Testing** > **Closed testing** in the left sidebar

<Note>
You're setting up a **Closed testing** release to prepare your app for in-app purchases. This step is required to enable Google Play Billing and internal testing. It **does not** publish your app to production or make it publicly available. You'll ship a production release when you're ready.
</Note>

  <Step title="Create and release a closed test build">
    <Info>
    This step is required to enable Google Play Billing and in-app purchases. You'll upload the production build (.aab file) you created in the previous step.

    ### Upload your build

    ### Send for review (closed test only)
    This submits your release for the **Closed testing** track only and is required to enable Google Play Billing and in-app purchases. It is **not** a production submission.
    
    1. Google will run automatic checks for common issues
    2. If there are issues: View and fix them, then return to **Overview**
    3. If no issues: Click **Send X change(s) for review**
    4. Confirm by clicking **Send changes for review**
    
    <Note>
    Reviews are typically completed within 7 days, but small releases are usually approved within a day.
    </Note>
    
    <Check>
    Once approved, your closed test will be live and you can test in-app purchases with your configured testers.

## How testers join your closed test

You can find the Opt-in URL in the closed track you created under **Testers** > **How testers join your test**:
- Join on Android
- Join on the web

Copy the URL and open it on your testing device (or any browser logged in with that testing user) to make the user a tester.

Opening the link will show a Google Play page with a **BECOME A TESTER** button. Press that button and your user will be able to make testing purchases on your testing device.

<Info>
They will also be added as a tester in the closed testing track. You need 12 users testing your app for 14 days to be able to publish your app to the Play Store.
</Info>

<Tip>
Share the opt-in URL with your testers via email or messaging. They need to click the link and become testers before they can download and test your app.
