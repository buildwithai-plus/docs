## How Testers Join Your Closed Test

You can find the Opt-in URL in the closed track you created under **Testers** > **How testers join your test**:
- Join on Android
- Join on the web

Copy the URL and open it on your testing device (or any browser logged in with that testing user) to make the user a tester.

Opening the link will show a Google Play page with a **BECOME A TESTER** button. Press that button and your user will be able to make testing purchases on your testing device.

They will also be added as a tester in the closed testing track. You need 12 users testing your app for 14 days to be able to publish your app to the Play Store.

## Next Steps

With your closed testing track set up, you can now:

1. [Create subscription products](./android-products) for your Android app
2. [Import your products into RevenueCat](./import-products-rc) for subscription management
3. [Set up Superwall](./superwall) for paywall management
