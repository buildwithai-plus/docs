<Info>
If you haven't build your apps core features yet. You are better off coming back to these steps later before you deploy your app to the App Stores.

## Components and Flow

In-app purchases involve several components working together:

1. **App Stores** - Where you configure your products and handle transactions
   - Google Play Console for Android
   - App Store Connect for iOS

2. **RevenueCat** - A subscription management service that:
   - Syncs products from both platforms
   - Provides cross-platform purchase verification
   - Manages subscription status

3. **Superwall** - A paywall management service that:
   - Creates beautiful paywalls without code
   - Handles A/B testing
   - Manages campaigns and conversions

4. **Your App** - Where the user interacts with paywalls and makes purchases

## Implementation Steps

![In-App Purchase Flow](/images/iap-flow-diagram.png)

### 1. Platform Setup
- [Google Play Console Setup](./google-play-console-setup) - Create and configure your Android app
- [App Store Connect Setup](./app-store-connect-setup) - Create and configure your iOS app

### 2. Product Configuration
- [Android Products Setup](./android-products) - Create subscription products for Android
- [iOS Products Setup](./ios-products) - Create subscription products for iOS

### 3. Testing Configuration
- [Android Closed Testing](./closed-testing) - Set up testing for Android in-app purchases
- [iOS Sandbox Testing](./ios-sandbox) - Test in-app purchases on iOS

### 4. Integration
- [RevenueCat Setup](./revenuecat) - Configure your products and purchases
- [Superwall Setup](./superwall) - Configure paywalls

## Enable Billing in Your Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Billing Permissions">
    Before creating your production builds for testing or release, you need to enable billing functionality in your Expo/React Native project:

    1. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    npx expo install expo-superwall react-native-purchases expo-build-properties
    ```

    2. Add the expo plugin to your `app.json`:
    ```json
    [  
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "16.0"
          },
          "android": {
            "minSdkVersion": 26
          }
        }
    ]
    ```

    This will install the necessary packages and configure your project with the minimum SDK versions required for in-app purchases. These packages will automatically add the necessary `BILLING` permission to your Android app and set up the iOS requirements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

Start by setting up your app in the respective app stores:
- For Android apps, begin with [Google Play Console Setup](./google-play-console-setup)
- For iOS apps, begin with [App Store Connect Setup](./app-store-connect-setup)

If you're building for both platforms, we recommend setting up both platforms in parallel.
