## Introduction

This guide shows you how to access BuildWithAI Boilerplate documentation directly through Windsurf using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

<Info>**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** allows AI assistants like Cascade to connect with external tools and data sources, enhancing their capabilities.</Info>

## What is the BuildWithAI MCP Server?

The BuildWithAI MCP server lets you search through our documentation **directly** from Windsurf. This means:

- Get immediate answers to your questions about BuildWithAI Boilerplate
- Find relevant code examples and implementation guides
- Access documentation without leaving your development environment

## Adding BuildWithAI MCP server to Cursor

You can easily add the BuildWithAI MCP server to Cursor:

1. On any BuildWithAI documentation page, click the dropdown menu button next to "Copy page"
   
2. Select "Connect to Cursor"
   
   ![Connect to Cursor option](/images/mcp-cursor.png)
   
3. This will prompt you to open Cursor
   
4. Follow the instructions in Cursor to add the BuildWithAI MCP server

<Accordion title="Configuring the MCP Server in Windsurf">
If you prefer using Windsurf instead of Cursor, follow these steps:

### 1. Add the BuildWithAI MCP Server

1. Click on the **MCP Servers** icon in the top toolbar of the Cascade window
   
   ![MCP Servers button](/images/mcp-servers-button.png)
   
2. Click **Manage Servers**
   
3. Click **View raw config** <Icon icon="file-text" color="#fff" /> 

    This will open your `mcp_config.json` file

#### If your configuration file is empty

If your file only contains `{"mcpServers": {}}`, replace the entire content with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "buildwithai": {
      "serverUrl": "https://docs.buildwithai.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### If you already have other MCP servers configured

If you already have other servers configured, add the BuildWithAI server inside the `mcpServers` object (don't forget to add a comma after the previous server):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "existing-server": {
      // existing configuration
    },
    "buildwithai": {
      "serverUrl": "https://docs.buildwithai.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Save and Refresh Your Configuration

After editing the configuration:

1. Save the `mcp_config.json` file
   
2. Close the file
   
3. Go back to the "Manage MCP servers" window (where you clicked "View raw config")
   
4. Click the **Refresh** <Icon icon="rotate-cw" color="#fff" /> button
   
5. You should now see BuildWithAI appearing in your list of available MCP servers

## Using the BuildWithAI MCP Server

Once the MCP server is set up, you can immediately start using it with Cascade:

### Example prompts to Cascade:

```text
How do I set up Google authentication in the BuildWithAI Boilerplate?
```

```text
Show me how to implement in-app purchases for iOS in the BuildWithAI Boilerplate?
```

```text
Add some appropriate icons to this component using the BuildWithAI Boilerplate.
```

Cascade will search through the BuildWithAI documentation and provide you with relevant information, code examples, and implementation guides directly in the chat.

## Testing Your MCP Server

To verify that your MCP server is working correctly:

1. **Test Basic Query**: Ask Cascade a simple question about BuildWithAI Boilerplate
2. **Verify Response**: Ensure the response includes relevant documentation information
3. **Test Code Examples**: Ask for specific code examples and verify they're accurate
4. **Check Links**: Verify that any links provided in responses are working

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the BuildWithAI MCP server:

1. Verify that your `mcp_config.json` file is correctly formatted
   
2. Ensure that you've clicked the refresh button after adding the plugin
   
3. Check your internet connection to ensure you can reach the BuildWithAI MCP server
   
4. Try restarting Windsurf if the plugin isn't appearing
