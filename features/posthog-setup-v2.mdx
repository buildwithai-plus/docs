<Note>
  This v2 guide sets up PostHog via the official AI wizard. You'll sign up if needed, choose your region (EU/US), and accept defaults. Our boilerplate already includes ready-to-uncomment PostHog code.
</Note>
 
<Info>
  The PostHog wizard is experimental. Feedback welcome at <i>joshua [at] posthog [dot] com</i>.

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the PostHog wizard">
    In your project root, run:

    ```bash
    npx @posthog/wizard --integration react-native
    ```

    When prompted:
    - Choose <b>Sign up</b> if you don't have an account yet
    - Select your data region: <b>EU</b> or <b>US</b>
    - Accept defaults for the rest
    
    <Info>
      The wizard uses sensible defaults by default (equivalent to <code>--default</code>). You can still answer prompts interactively.
    </Info>

    <Accordion title="Non-interactive examples (signup + region)">
      Run the wizard without prompts:

      ```bash
      # EU region + create account
      npx @posthog/wizard --integration react-native --signup --region eu

      # US region + create account
      npx @posthog/wizard --integration react-native --signup --region us
      ```
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable PostHog in the app">
    This boilerplate ships with PostHog code commented out. The wizard will detect this and intelligently update/uncomment the integration for React Native.

    - After the wizard completes, review the changes to `app/_layout.tsx`
    - You shouldn't need to manually uncomment anything
    - If it didn't apply correctly, revert the changes and use the classic guide: <a href="/features/posthog-setup"><u>PostHog (manual setup)</u></a>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Environment variables">
    The wizard writes the required environment variables for you.

    - Ensure `.env` or `.env.local` remains listed in your `.gitignore`
    - Verify that the following are present in your environment:
      - `EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY`
      - `EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` (eu/us host based on your selection)
    - If this doesn't work for you, revert and try the manual guide: <a href="/features/posthog-setup"><u>PostHog (manual setup)</u></a>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify tracking">
    Start the app, use a few screens, then in PostHog open <b>Live Events</b> to confirm events are arriving.

    Optional test snippet:

    ```tsx
    import { usePostHog } from 'posthog-react-native'
    import { Button } from 'react-native'

    export function Example() {
      const posthog = usePostHog()
      return <Button title="Test event" onPress={() => posthog.capture('test_event')} />
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optional: MCP integration

If you use MCP-enabled clients, you can add/remove the PostHog MCP server:

```bash
# Add
npx @posthog/wizard mcp add

# Remove
npx @posthog/wizard mcp remove
```

## Notes

<Tip>
  Region guidance:
  - <b>EU hosting</b> (Frankfurt): EU/GDPR-friendly, faster for EU users
  - <b>US hosting</b> (Virginia): faster for US users, common for US compliance
</Tip>

<Info>
  You can migrate regions later if needed. For advanced usage, see `npx @posthog/wizard --help`.
