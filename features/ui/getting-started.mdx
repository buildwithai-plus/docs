# Getting Started with UI & Styling

Welcome to the UI & Styling guide! If you're new to styling in React Native or feeling overwhelmed by all the options, you're in the right place. This guide will walk you through everything step-by-step, starting with the basics.

## What Are These Styling Systems?

Your app uses three complementary systems that work together to create beautiful, consistent interfaces:

### 1. Theme System

**What it is:** A collection of color variables that automatically adapt to light and dark mode.

**What it does:** Provides semantic color names like `primary` or `background` instead of hardcoded values like `#3B82F6`.

**When to use it:** Whenever you need to reference a color in your app.

### 2. NativeWind

**What it is:** A utility-first styling approach that lets you add styles directly in your JSX.

**What it does:** Transforms simple class names like `p-4` or `bg-primary` into actual styles.

**When to use it:** For all your component styling needs - spacing, layout, colors, typography.

### 3. React Native Reusables

**What it is:** A collection of pre-built, customizable UI components.

**What it does:** Provides ready-to-use components like buttons, cards, and inputs that follow best practices.

**When to use it:** When you need common UI elements that are already styled and accessible.

## How They Work Together

Think of these three systems like building a house:

üèóÔ∏è **Theme System** is the foundation - it defines your color palette and ensures consistency.

üß± **NativeWind** provides the building blocks - utility classes that let you construct any layout.

üè† **React Native Reusables** gives you pre-built rooms - complete components you can move in and use right away.

## Before & After: The Power of Styling

Let's see what a difference these systems make with a simple example:

### Before: Unstyled Component

```tsx
// üòï Unstyled component - functional but plain
function ProfileCard() {
  return (
    <View>
      <View>
        <Text>John Doe</Text>
        <Text>Premium Member</Text>
      </View>
      
      <View>
        <Text>Member since: January 2025</Text>
      </View>
      
      <View>
        <Pressable>
          <Text>Edit</Text>
        </Pressable>
        <Pressable>
          <Text>Delete</Text>
        </Pressable>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### After: Styled Component

```tsx
// ü§© Styled component - beautiful and consistent
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter } from '~/components/ui/card';
import { Button } from '~/components/ui/button';
import { Text } from '~/components/ui/text';

function ProfileCard() {
  return (
    <View className="p-4">
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>
          <Text className="text-xl font-bold">John Doe</Text>
          <Text className="text-muted-foreground">Premium Member</Text>
        </CardHeader>
        
        <CardContent>
          <View className="bg-muted p-3 rounded-md">
            <Text>Member since: January 2025</Text>
          </View>
        </CardContent>
        
        <CardFooter className="flex-row gap-2">
          <Button variant="outline">
            <Text>Edit</Text>
          </Button>
          <Button variant="destructive">
            <Text>Delete</Text>
          </Button>
        </CardFooter>
      </Card>
    </View>
  );
}
```

The styled version:
- Uses **theme colors** like `muted-foreground` for consistent coloring
- Applies **NativeWind classes** like `p-4` and `rounded-md` for spacing and appearance
- Incorporates **React Native Reusables** components like `Card` and `Button` for professional UI elements
