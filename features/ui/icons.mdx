# Icons System

React Native Reusables uses a streamlined approach to handle icons that integrates seamlessly with NativeWind styling. This system allows you to apply styling classes directly to your icons, creating a consistent design language throughout your application.

## How It Works

The icon system uses [Lucide React Native](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react-native) for the base icons and leverages NativeWind's `cssInterop` functionality to enable styling through className props. This is accomplished through a utility function called `iconWithClassName` that registers icons with NativeWind.

The `iconWithClassName` utility enables you to:

- Apply color styles to icons using Tailwind classes
- Control opacity through class names
- Maintain a consistent styling approach between components and icons

## Adding New Icons

To add a new icon to your project:

1. Create a new file in the `~/lib/icons/` directory with the name of the Lucide icon you want to use
2. Import the icon from `lucide-react-native`
3. Import the `iconWithClassName` utility from `./iconWithClassName`
4. Register the icon using `iconWithClassName`
5. Export the icon as a named export

### Example: Adding Icons

```tsx
// ~/lib/icons/Sun.tsx
import { Sun } from 'lucide-react-native';
import { iconWithClassName } from './iconWithClassName';

iconWithClassName(Sun);
export { Sun };
```

```tsx
// ~/lib/icons/MoonStar.tsx
import { MoonStar } from 'lucide-react-native';
import { iconWithClassName } from './iconWithClassName';

iconWithClassName(MoonStar);
export { MoonStar };
```

## Using Icons in Components

Once you've registered an icon, you can use it in your components with NativeWind classes:

```tsx
import { Sun } from '~/lib/icons/Sun';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View className="p-4">
      {/* Apply color and opacity styles directly via className */}
      <Sun className="text-blue-500 opacity-80" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Caution

When working with icons, remember these important points:

- **Always register your icons**: Icons must be wrapped with `iconWithClassName` to support styling via className
- **Create separate files**: Each icon should have its own file in the `~/lib/icons/` directory
- **Limited properties**: Only color and opacity can be controlled via className by default
