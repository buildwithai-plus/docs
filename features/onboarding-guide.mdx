## What to customize

- **Animations:** Replace Lottie files in `assets/onboarding/lotties/`
- **Text:** Update content in `lib/i18n/locales/en/onboarding.json` and `lib/i18n/locales/fr/onboarding.json`

## How to customize

<Steps>
  <Step title="Replace animations">
    1. Find Lottie animations from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) or [IconScout](https://iconscout.com/lotties)
    2. Download as `.json` files
    3. Replace files in `assets/onboarding/lotties/`
    4. Update filenames in `app/onboarding.tsx` (lines 22-25)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update text content">
    Edit both language files with your app's content:

    ```json lib/i18n/locales/en/onboarding.json
    {
      "slide1": {
        "title": "Your App Title Here",
        "description": "Describe your app's main benefit"
      },
      "slide2": {
        "title": "Second Feature", 
        "description": "Explain another key feature"
      },
      "slide3": {
        "title": "Third Feature",
        "description": "Highlight another benefit"
      },
      "slide4": {
        "title": "Get Started",
        "description": "Final call to action"
      }
    }
    ```

    <Note>
    Translate the same structure to French in `lib/i18n/locales/fr/onboarding.json`.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add or remove slides (optional)">
    **Add a slide:**
    1. Add Lottie file to `assets/onboarding/lotties/`
    2. Add filename to `app/onboarding.tsx`
    3. Add text in both `onboarding.json` files (e.g., `"slide5"`)

    **Remove a slide:**
    1. Remove Lottie reference from `app/onboarding.tsx`
    2. Remove text from both `onboarding.json` files
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your onboarding will automatically update with your new content. Test it by running your app and checking that all animations and text appear correctly.
</Check>

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Animations:** Keep file sizes under 500KB, use consistent style, and choose animations that represent your app's core features.

**Text:** Keep titles under 40 characters, descriptions to 1-2 sentences, focus on benefits over features, and use action-oriented language.
</Tip>
