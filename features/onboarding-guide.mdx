## Overview

Your app comes with a template onboarding experience that introduces users to your app's key features. This guide shows you how to customize it for your app.

## What You Need to Update

### 1. Animation Files (Lottie)

**Location:** `assets/onboarding/lotties/`

We've included some free Lottie animations from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/free-animations) to get you started. Replace these with animations that better match **your** app.

### 2. Text Content

**Location:** 
- `lib/i18n/locales/en/onboarding.json` (English)
- `lib/i18n/locales/fr/onboarding.json` (French)

## How to Customize

<Steps>
  <Step title="Replace Animation Files">
    1. **Find Lottie animations** that match your app's theme:
       - **Free sources:** [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/), [IconScout](https://iconscout.com/lotties)
       - **Create your own:** Use [LottieFiles Editor](https://editor.lottiefiles.com/) or Adobe After Effects

    2. **Download your animations** as `.json` files

    3. **Replace the existing files** in `assets/onboarding/lotties/`:
       - Upload your own `.json` files with your preferred filenames
       - Update the filenames in `app/onboarding.tsx` (around line 22-25) to match your new files
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Text Content">
    Edit the JSON files to match your app's content:

    **English** (`lib/i18n/locales/en/onboarding.json`):
    ```json
    {
      "slide1": {
        "title": "Your App Title Here",
        "description": "Describe your app's main benefit"
      },
      "slide2": {
        "title": "Second Feature",
        "description": "Explain another key feature"
      },
      "slide3": {
        "title": "Third Feature", 
        "description": "Highlight another benefit"
      },
      "slide4": {
        "title": "Get Started",
        "description": "Final call to action"
      }
    }
    ```

    **French** (`lib/i18n/locales/fr/onboarding.json`):
    - Translate the same content structure to French
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add or Remove Slides (Optional)">
    You can easily customize the number of onboarding slides:

    **To add a slide:**
    1. Add a new Lottie file to `assets/onboarding/lotties/`
    2. Add the filename to `app/onboarding.tsx` 
    3. Add corresponding text in both `onboarding.json` files (e.g., `"slide5"`)

    **To remove a slide:**
    1. Remove the Lottie file reference from `app/onboarding.tsx`
    2. Remove the corresponding text from both `onboarding.json` files
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Your onboarding will automatically update with your new content. Test it by running your app and checking that all animations and text appear correctly.

## Tips for Great Onboarding

<Accordion title="Animation Selection">
  - Choose animations that represent your app's core features
  - Keep file sizes under 500KB for fast loading
  - Use consistent style/color scheme across all animations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Text Guidelines">
  - Keep titles short and impactful (under 40 characters)
  - Descriptions should be 1-2 sentences max
  - Focus on benefits, not just features
  - Use action-oriented language
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Recommended Animation Themes">
  - **Slide 1:** App launch, rocket, or main feature
  - **Slide 2:** Core functionality or user interaction
  - **Slide 3:** Key benefit or unique feature
  - **Slide 4:** Success, completion, or call-to-action
</Accordion>

## Example Implementation

Here's how to add a 5th slide to your onboarding:

```json
{
  "slide1": { "title": "...", "description": "..." },
  "slide2": { "title": "...", "description": "..." },
  "slide3": { "title": "...", "description": "..." },
  "slide4": { "title": "...", "description": "..." },
  "slide5": { "title": "New Feature", "description": "Describe your new feature" }
}
```

Then update your `app/onboarding.tsx` file to include the new slide:

```tsx
// In app/onboarding.tsx
const lotties = [
  require('../assets/onboarding/lotties/animation1.json'),
  require('../assets/onboarding/lotties/animation2.json'),
  require('../assets/onboarding/lotties/animation3.json'),
  require('../assets/onboarding/lotties/animation4.json'),
  require('../assets/onboarding/lotties/animation5.json'), // New animation
];
```

<Tip>
  For the best user experience, limit your onboarding to 3-5 slides. Too many slides can cause users to skip the entire onboarding process.
