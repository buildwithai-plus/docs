<Warning>
  **App Store Requirement**: If you implement Google Sign-In for iOS, Apple requires that you **must** also implement [Apple Sign-In](/features/auth/apple-auth) to pass the App Store review process. This is a mandatory requirement from Apple, not optional.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Google Sign-In, make sure you have:

- [Set up your Supabase project](/quickstart/supabase-setup) with basic configuration

## Step 1: Set Up a Google Cloud Project

<Info>
If you've already set up [Push Notifications](/features/push-setup) for Android, you likely have a Google Cloud project. You can use the same project for Google Sign-In.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Create a new Google Cloud Project">
1. Create a Google Cloud project for your app in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate), if you don't have one already

- Give it the name of your app
- Select the organization you want to use
- Click Create
- Wait for the project to be created 
</Accordion>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the Google Sign-In API">
  - Select your Google Cloud project
  - Click on APIs & Services in the left menu
  - Click "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" at the top
  - Search for "Google Identity" and select "Google Identity Services API"
  - Click Enable
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the consent screen">
  - Pick the OAuth Consent Screen option in the left menu
  - Click "Get started"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete the consent screen configuration">
  - App Information: Fill it out the form with App Name and User support email
  - Audience: pick "External"
  - Contact Information: These email addresses are for Google to notify you about any changes to your project
  - Finish: Agree to the Google API Services: User Data Policy
  - Press "Create"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create Web OAuth Client ID

You need to create a Web OAuth Client ID for Supabase authentication to work properly. This client is required regardless of which platform (iOS/Android) you're targeting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Google Cloud Console">
    In the Google Cloud console, navigate to **Menu** > **Google Auth platform** > **Clients**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create OAuth Client">
    1. Click the **Create Client** button
    2. For Application type, select **Web application**
    3. In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for your credential (e.g., "Supabase Web Client")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Authorized URIs">
    Set up the appropriate URIs for your application:

    1. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, click **Add URI**
       - Enter your Supabase project URL from `.env` (e.g. `https://yourprojectref.supabase.co`)

    2. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **Add URI**
       - Enter your Supabase project URL from `.env` + `/auth/v1/callback` (e.g. `https://yourprojectref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate and Save Credentials">
    1. Click **Create** to generate your OAuth client ID
    2. Your new credentials will appear after they are created: 
       
    3. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - you'll need these to configure Supabase
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  This web client is required for Supabase authentication integration. You'll use these credentials in the Supabase dashboard to enable Google authentication.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Configure Supabase Google Provider

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Supabase Authentication Settings">
    1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com)
    2. Select your project
    3. Navigate to **Authentication** in the left sidebar
    4. Select **Sign In / Providers** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Google Provider">
    1. Find and click on the **Google** provider
    2. Toggle the switch to **Enable** the Google provider
    3. Client ID: Enter your **Client ID** (e.g. `your-web-client-id`)
    4. Client Secret: Enter your **Client Secret**
    5. Callback URL (for OAuth): Verify that the **Callback URL** matches the **Redirect URI** you set up in the Google Cloud Console
       (e.g. `https://yourprojectref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`)
    6. Click **Save** to apply your changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Create Platform-Specific OAuth Clients

After setting up the web client for Supabase, you need to create platform-specific OAuth clients for each platform you want to support.

  <Tab title="Android">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Get SHA-1 Certificate Fingerprint from Expo Dashboard">
        1. Go to the [Expo Dashboard Project Credentials page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[ACCOUNT]/projects/[PROJECT]/credentials)
        2. Click on your **Application Identifier** (e.g., com.buildwithai.travelapp)
        3. Under the **Android upload keystore** section, find and copy the **SHA-1 Fingerprint**
        4. Save this value for the next step.

      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Android OAuth Client ID">
        1. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to **Menu** > **Google Auth platform** > **Clients**
        2. Click the **Create Client** button
        3. Select **Android** as the application type
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure Android Client Settings">
        1. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your Android application
        2. Enter your app's **Package name** in the Package name field
           * This should match the package name in your `app.json` (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`)
        3. Enter the **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint** you copied earlier
        4. Click the **Create** button
        5. Save your Android Client ID - you'll need it for your app configuration
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="iOS">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create iOS OAuth Client ID">
        1. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to **Menu** > **Google Auth platform** > **Clients**
        2. Click the **Create Client** button
        3. Select **iOS** as the application type
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure iOS Client Settings">
        1. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your iOS application
        2. Enter your app's **Bundle ID** in the Bundle ID field
           * This should match the Bundle ID in your `app.json` (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`)
        3. Click the **Create** button
        4. Save your iOS Client ID - you'll need it for your app configuration
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Enable Google Sign-In in Your App

Now that you've set up all the necessary OAuth clients, you need to configure your app to use Google Sign-In:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Follow the implementation instructions in the `integrations/google-auth/README.md` file included in your boilerplate codebase. This file contains all necessary steps for setting up Google Sign-In in your application, including:
    
    - File activation
    - Package installation
    - Environment variables configuration
    - Platform-specific setup for iOS and Android
    - Code enablement
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you've completed the implementation steps, the Google Sign-In button will appear in the authentication screens and be fully functional on both iOS and Android.

## Testing Your Configuration

1. Rebuild development build and open it on your device
2. Navigate to the sign-in screen
3. Tap the "Sign in with Google" button
4. Complete the Google authentication flow
5. Verify that you are successfully signed in to your app
