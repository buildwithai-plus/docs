Official docs: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id

## Step 2: Create Web OAuth Client ID

You need to create a Web OAuth Client ID for Supabase authentication to work properly. This client is required regardless of which platform (iOS/Android) you're targeting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Google Cloud Console">
    In the Google Cloud console, navigate to **Menu** > **Google Auth platform** > **Clients**
    
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create OAuth Client">
    1. Click the **Create Client** button
    2. For Application type, select **Web application**
    3. In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for your credential (e.g., "Supabase Web Client")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Authorized URIs">
    Set up the appropriate URIs for your application:

    1. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, click **Add URI**
       - Enter `https://yourprojectref.supabase.co` (replace with your actual Supabase project URL)

    2. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **Add URI**
       - Enter `https://yourprojectref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` (replace with your actual Supabase project URL)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate and Save Credentials">
    1. Click **Create** to generate your OAuth client ID
    2. Your new credentials will appear after they are created: 
       
    3. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - you'll need these to configure Supabase
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  This web client is required for Supabase authentication integration. You'll use these credentials in the Supabase dashboard to enable Google authentication.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Configure Supabase Google Provider

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Supabase Authentication Settings">
    1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
    2. Select your project
    3. Navigate to **Authentication** in the left sidebar
    4. Select **Providers** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Google Provider">
    1. Find and click on the **Google** provider
    2. Toggle the switch to **Enable** the Google provider
    3. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the web client you created in Step 2
    4. Verify that the **Redirect URL** matches what you set up in the Google Cloud Console
       (`https://yourprojectref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`)
    5. Click **Save** to apply your changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Create Platform-Specific OAuth Clients

After setting up the web client for Supabase, you need to create platform-specific OAuth clients for each platform you want to support.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Android">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Generate SHA-1 Certificate Fingerprint">
        1. Run this command in your terminal to obtain the SHA-1 fingerprint:

        ```bash
        keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
        ```

        2. Look for the line that starts with "SHA1:" in the output.
        3. It will look something like: `SHA1: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`
        4. Save this value for the next step.

        <Tip>
          For production apps, you'll need to generate a separate fingerprint using your release keystore.
        </Tip>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Android OAuth Client ID">
        1. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to **Menu** > **Google Auth platform** > **Clients**
        2. Click the **Create Client** button
        3. Select **Android** as the application type
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure Android Client Settings">
        1. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your Android application
        2. Enter your app's **Package name** in the Package name field
           * This should match the package name in your `app.json` under `android.package`
        3. Enter the **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint** you generated earlier
        4. Click the **Create** button
        5. Save your Android Client ID - you'll need it for your app configuration
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="iOS">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create iOS OAuth Client ID">
        1. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to **Menu** > **Google Auth platform** > **Clients**
        2. Click the **Create Client** button
        3. Select **iOS** as the application type
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure iOS Client Settings">
        1. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your iOS application
        2. Enter your app's **Bundle ID** in the Bundle ID field
           * This should match the Bundle ID in your `app.json` under `ios.bundleIdentifier`
        3. Click the **Create** button
        4. Save your iOS Client ID - you'll need it for your app configuration
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Enable Google Sign-In in Your App

Now that you've set up all the necessary OAuth clients, you need to configure your app to use Google Sign-In:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the Basic Feature">
    1. Rename the example file by running:
    
    ```bash
    mv lib/auth/methods/google-auth.ts.example lib/auth/methods/google-auth.ts
    ```
    
    2. Install the required dependency:
    
    ```bash
    npx expo install @react-native-google-signin/google-signin
    ```
    
    3. Update your `.env` file with your Google OAuth web client ID (from Step 2):
    
    ```env
    EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-web-client-id
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS Configuration">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Environment Variables">
        Add your iOS Client ID to your `.env` file:
        
        ```env
        EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_OAUTH_IOS_CLIENT_ID=your-ios-client-id
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Update app.json Configuration">
        Update your `app.json` to add iOS-specific Google Sign-In configuration:
        
        ```json
        {
          "expo": {
            "plugins": [
              // Add this to the plugins array
              [
                "@react-native-google-signin/google-signin",
                {
                  "iosUrlScheme": "your-ios-client-id"
                }
              ]
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Android Configuration">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Environment Variables">
        Add your Android Client ID to your `.env` file:
        
        ```env
        EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_OAUTH_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=your-android-client-id
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Update app.json Configuration">
        Update your `app.json` to add Android-specific Google Sign-In configuration:
        
        ```json
        {
          "expo": {
            "android": {
              // Add this to the android section
              "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Uncomment Feature Code">
    The boilerplate already includes all necessary code for Google Sign-In, but it's commented out by default.
    Uncomment all code blocks marked with `TODO: GOOGLE SIGN-IN` in these files:
    
    - `lib/auth/context.tsx`
    - `app/welcome.tsx`
    - `app/login.tsx`
    - `app/register.tsx`
    
    Each file contains clear TODO comments marking the sections to uncomment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you've completed these steps, the Google Sign-In button will appear in the authentication screens and be fully functional on both iOS and Android.

## Testing Your Configuration

<Info>
  You must create a development build to test Google Sign-In functionality, as native authentication features won't work in Expo Go.
</Info>

After creating a development build, test your Google Sign-In configuration:

1. Make sure you have added all the environment variables to your app
2. Run your app using the development build
3. Navigate to the sign-in screen
4. Tap the "Sign in with Google" button
5. Complete the Google authentication flow
6. Verify that you are successfully signed in to your app
