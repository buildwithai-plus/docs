## Setting up Supabase Authentication

The BuildWithAI+ boilerplate uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as its authentication provider, giving you access to multiple authentication methods, user management, and secure session handling. This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase authentication for your mobile app.

### Creating a Supabase Project

1. **Create a Supabase account**:
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://database.new) and sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create a new project**:
   - Click "New Project" in the Supabase dashboard
   - Fill in your project details:
     - Name: Choose a name for your project
     - Database Password: Just use the existing one (DON'T share it)
     - Region: Choose a region closest to your target users
   - Click "Create project"

3. **Wait for project initialization**:
   - This may take a few minutes while Supabase provisions your database and authentication services

### Configuring Your Project

Once your Supabase project is created, you'll need to get your project credentials:

1. **Get your project URL and anon key**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy the "URL" and "anon/public" key

2. **Add credentials to your app**:
   - Open the `.env` file you created earlier from `.env.example`
   - Update your Supabase credentials:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

3. **Configure EAS secrets** for deployment builds:

```bash
eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL --value "https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY --value "your-anon-key"
```

### URL Configuration for Authentication

1. **Configure authentication settings**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
   - Configure the following settings:

#### Site URL

- Set your site URL to your app's scheme that you configured in `app.json` (e.g., `your-scheme://`)
  - This MUST match the `scheme` value in your `app.json`
- For Expo Go development, use `exp://localhost:8081` 

#### Redirect URLs

Add the following redirect URLs:

- Your app scheme followed by `**` (e.g., `your-scheme://**`)
- For Expo Go, use `exp://localhost:8081/**`

<Tip>
  The scheme is used when your app runs as a standalone build (development build, production app), while the Expo Go URLs are used during development with Expo Go.
</Tip>

### Testing Authentication

Once your Supabase project is set up with the correct URL configuration, you can test basic authentication functionality:

1. Run your app in development mode
2. Navigate to the sign-in screen
3. Test the authentication flow

### Next Steps

After basic Supabase setup, you can configure social authentication providers:

- [Google Sign-In Setup](/features/auth/google-auth)
- [Apple Sign-In Setup](/features/auth/apple-auth)

### Additional Resources

- [Supabase Auth Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth)
- [Supabase JavaScript Client Reference](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/)

### Customizing Authentication Options

You can customize various authentication settings in the Supabase dashboard:

1. **Email templates**:
   - Navigate to Authentication → Email Templates
   - Customize the magic link, confirmation, and invitation email templates

2. **Password policies**:
   - Go to Authentication → Policies
   - Set password strength requirements

3. **Session settings**:
   - Configure session timeouts and refresh periods in Authentication → Settings

### Testing Authentication Setup

After completing the setup:

1. **Run your app**
2. **Navigate to the login screen**
3. **Try signing up** with email/password to ensure authentication is working correctly

If the authentication flow works successfully, you'll be able to sign up, log in, and access protected routes in your app.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
