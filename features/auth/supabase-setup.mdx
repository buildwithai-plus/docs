## Setting up Supabase Authentication

The BuildWithAI+ boilerplate uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as its authentication provider, giving you access to multiple authentication methods, user management, and secure session handling. This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase authentication for your mobile app.

### Creating a Supabase Project

1. **Create a Supabase account**:
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create a new project**:
   - Click "New Project" in the Supabase dashboard
   - Fill in your project details:
     - Name: Choose a name for your project
     - Database Password: Generate a strong password (save this securely)
     - Region: Choose a region closest to your target users
   - Click "Create project"

3. **Wait for project initialization**:
   - This may take a few minutes while Supabase provisions your database and authentication services

### Configuring Your Project

Once your Supabase project is created, you'll need to get your project credentials:

1. **Get your project URL and anon key**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy the "URL" and "anon/public" key

2. **Add credentials to your app**:
   - In your local project, open or create the `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your Supabase credentials:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

3. **Configure EAS secrets** for deployment builds:

```bash
npx eas secret:create --scope project --name SUPABASE_URL --value "https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
npx eas secret:create --scope project --name SUPABASE_ANON_KEY --value "your-anon-key"
```

### Setting Up Auth Provider

The boilerplate already includes an authentication provider set up in `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`. This provider initializes the Supabase client and provides authentication context throughout your app.

The provider handles:
- User session state management
- Login, signup, and logout functions
- Session refresh and recovery
- Authentication persistence

### Configuring Auth Redirect URLs

For social authentication to work correctly, you need to set up redirect URLs in Supabase:

1. **Go to Authentication settings**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to Authentication → URL Configuration
   
2. **Configure site URL**:
   - Set the Site URL to match your app's production URL or to `https://auth.expo.io/@your-username/your-app-slug` for development

3. **Add redirect URLs**:
   - Add the following URLs to the "Redirect URLs" section:
     - `myapp://auth-callback` (replace `myapp` with your app's URL scheme from app.json)
     - `https://auth.expo.io/@your-username/your-app-slug` (for Expo development)

### Customizing Authentication Options

You can customize various authentication settings in the Supabase dashboard:

1. **Email templates**:
   - Navigate to Authentication → Email Templates
   - Customize the magic link, confirmation, and invitation email templates

2. **Password policies**:
   - Go to Authentication → Policies
   - Set password strength requirements

3. **Session settings**:
   - Configure session timeouts and refresh periods in Authentication → Settings

### Testing Authentication Setup

After completing the setup:

1. **Run your app** in development mode
2. **Navigate to the login screen**
3. **Try signing up** with email/password to ensure authentication is working correctly

If the authentication flow works successfully, you'll be able to sign up, log in, and access protected routes in your app.
