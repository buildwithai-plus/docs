<Warning>
  **App Store Requirement**: Apple requires that if you implement any third-party authentication options (like Google, Facebook, or Twitter) in your iOS app, you **must** also implement Apple Sign-In to pass the App Store review process. This is a mandatory requirement from Apple, not optional.
  
  See [Apple's Sign-In Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple) for more details.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Apple Sign-In, make sure you have:

- [Set up your Supabase project](/quickstart/supabase-setup) with basic configuration
- An Apple Developer account (requires paid enrollment in the Apple Developer Program)
- Access to the Apple Developer Portal

## Setting Up Apple Sign-In

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an App ID in the Apple Developer Portal">
    1. Go to the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
    2. Under `Certificates, IDs & Profiles`, click on `Identifiers`.
    3. Click the `+` button to create a new identifier
    4. Select `App IDs` and click `Continue`
    5. Choose `App` as the type and click `Continue`
    6. Fill in a description (e.g., "My App") 
    7. Enter your `Bundle Identifier` that matches your `app.json` (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`)
    8. Scroll down to `Capabilities` and enable `Sign In with Apple`
    10. Click `Continue` then `Register` on the top right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Service ID">
    1. Go to the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
    2. Under `Certificates, IDs & Profiles`, click on `Identifiers`.
    3. Click the `+` button to create a new identifier
    4. Select `Service IDs` and click `Continue`
    5. Fill in a description (e.g., "My App - Apple Sign In")
    6. Enter a unique identifier, which could be your app ID with `.signin` appended (e.g. `com.buildwithai.travelapp.signin`)
    7. Click `Continue` then `Register` on the top right
    
    After registration:
    
    8. Click on your newly created Service ID from the list
    9. Check `Sign In with Apple` and click `Configure`
    10. Add your Supabase domain as a Website URL (your Supabase project URL in `.env`)
    11. Add your return URL (your Supabase project URL in `.env` + `/auth/v1/callback`)
    12. Click `Save`, then `Continue`, and `Save` again
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Private Key">
    1. Go to the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
    2. Under `Certificates, IDs & Profiles`, click on `Keys` in the sidebar
    3. Click the `+` button to create a new key
    4. Enter a name for your key (e.g., "My App Sign In Key")
    5. Check `Sign In with Apple` and click `Configure`
    6. Select your primary App ID (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`) and click `Save`
    7. Click `Continue` then `Register`
    8. **Download** your private key file (a file with `.p8` at the end) - this can **only** be downloaded once
    9. Note your `Key ID` for later use
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generate a client_secret

The secret key you downloaded is used to create the client_secret string you'll need to authenticate your users. According to the Apple Docs it needs to be a JWT token encrypted using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm.

This integration includes a script to generate the required client secret JWT for Apple Sign-In.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Get your Apple Developer credentials:**
   - **Team ID**: Found in Apple Developer Portal → Membership → Team ID
   - **Service ID**: The identifier you created (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp.signin`)
   - **Key ID**: The 10-character ID from your private key
   - **Private Key**: The `.p8` file you downloaded from Apple Developer Portal

2. **Configure the script:**
   - Open `integrations/apple-auth/gen-apple-secret.js` in your code editor
   - Replace the placeholder values at the top:
   ```javascript
   const TEAM_ID   = "1A2B3C4D5E";              // Your actual Team ID
   const CLIENT_ID = "com.buildwithai.travelapp.signin";  // Your Service ID
   const KEY_ID    = "ABCD123456";              // Your Key ID
   const KEY_FILE  = "./AuthKey_ABCD123456.p8"; // Your .p8 filename
   ```

3. **Add your private key file:**
   - Copy your `.p8` file to the same folder as `gen-apple-secret.js`
   - Make sure the filename matches what you put in `KEY_FILE`

4. **Generate the client secret:**
   ```bash
   node integrations/apple-auth/gen-apple-secret.js
   ```
   
   The script will automatically install the required dependency if needed.

5. **Copy the result:**
   - The script will output a long JWT token
   - Copy the entire token (it starts with `eyJ...`)

6. **Add to Supabase:**
   - Go to your Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to Authentication → Sign In / Providers
   - Find "Apple" and click to configure
   - Enable "Sign in with Apple"
   - Paste the JWT as "Secret Key (for OAuth)"
   - Set "Client IDs" to your Service ID
   - Click Save





## Enabling Apple Sign-In in Your App

Now that you've set up Apple Sign-In with Supabase, you need to enable the feature in your app codebase:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Follow the implementation instructions in the `integrations/apple-auth/README.md` file included in your boilerplate codebase. This file contains all necessary steps for setting up Apple Sign-In in your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you've completed the implementation steps, the Apple Sign-In button will appear in the authentication screens and be fully functional - on iOS only.

### Testing Your Configuration

To test your Apple Sign-In configuration:

1. Rebuild development build
2. Navigate to the sign-in screen
3. Tap the "Sign in with Apple" button
4. Complete the Apple authentication flow
5. Verify that you are successfully signed in to your app
