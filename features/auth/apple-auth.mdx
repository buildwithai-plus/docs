<Warning>
  **App Store Requirement**: Apple requires that if you implement any third-party authentication options (like Google, Facebook, or Twitter) in your iOS app, you **must** also implement Apple Sign-In to pass the App Store review process. This is a mandatory requirement from Apple, not optional.
  
  See [Apple's Sign-In Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple) for more details.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Apple Sign-In, make sure you have:

- [Set up your Supabase project](/features/auth/supabase-setup) with basic configuration
- An Apple Developer account (requires paid enrollment in the Apple Developer Program)
- Access to the Apple Developer Portal

## Setting Up Apple Sign-In

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an App ID in the Apple Developer Portal">
    1. Go to the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
    2. Navigate to `Certificates, IDs & Profiles`
    3. Click on `Identifiers` in the left sidebar
    4. Click the `+` button to create a new identifier
    5. Select `App IDs` and click `Continue`
    6. Choose `App` as the type and click `Continue`
    7. Fill in a description (e.g., "My App") 
    8. Enter your `Bundle Identifier` that matches your `app.json` (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`)
    9. Scroll down to `Capabilities` and enable `Sign In with Apple`
    10. Click `Continue` then `Register` on the top right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Service ID">
    1. In the Apple Developer Portal, go to `Certificates, IDs & Profiles`
    2. Click on `Identifiers` in the left sidebar
    3. Click the `+` button to create a new identifier
    4. Select `Service IDs` and click `Continue`
    5. Fill in a description (e.g., "My App - Apple Sign In")
    6. Enter a unique identifier, which could be your app ID with `.signin` appended (e.g. `com.buildwithai.travelapp.signin`)
    7. Click `Continue` then `Register` on the top right
    
    After registration:
    
    8. Click on your newly created Service ID from the list
    9. Check `Sign In with Apple` and click `Configure`
    10. Add your Supabase domain as a Website URL (your Supabase project URL in `.env`)
    11. Add your return URL (your Supabase project URL in `.env` + `/auth/v1/callback`)
    12. Click `Save`, then `Continue`, and `Save` again
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Private Key">
    1. In the Apple Developer Portal, go to `Certificates, IDs & Profiles`
    2. Click on `Keys` in the sidebar
    3. Click the `+` button to create a new key
    4. Enter a name for your key (e.g., "My App Sign In Key")
    5. Check `Sign In with Apple` and click `Configure`
    6. Select your primary App ID (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp`) and click `Save`
    7. Click `Continue` then `Register`
    8. **Download** your private key file (a file with `.p8` at the end) - this can **only** be downloaded once
    9. Note your `Key ID` for later use
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generate a client_secret

The secret key you downloaded is used to create the client_secret string you'll need to authenticate your users.

According to the Apple Docs it needs to be a JWT token encrypted using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
/**
 * gen_apple_secret.js
 * Simple "Sign in with Apple" client_secret generator
 * Usage: node gen_apple_secret.js
 */

// ðŸ‘‰ FILL THESE IN:
const TEAM_ID   = "YOUR_TEAM_ID";             // e.g. 1A2B3C4D5E
const CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";           // e.g. com.buildwithai.travelapp.signin
const KEY_ID    = "YOUR_KEY_ID";              // the 10-char Key ID
const KEY_FILE  = "./AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8";  // path to your .p8 file

import fs from "fs";
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

// Read your private key
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync(KEY_FILE, "utf8");

// Build timestamps
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const exp = now + 180 * 24 * 3600; // 180 days

// Sign the JWT
const token = jwt.sign(
  {
    iss: TEAM_ID,
    iat: now,
    exp,
    aud: "https://appleid.apple.com",
    sub: CLIENT_ID
  },
  privateKey,
  {
    algorithm: "ES256",
    keyid: KEY_ID
  }
);

// Output to console
console.log("\nðŸ”‘ Your client_secret JWT:\n");
console.log(token);
console.log();
```

### Quick Steps

1. Drop `gen_apple_secret.js` and your `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8` into your Expo project root.

2. Install `jsonwebtoken`:

```bash
npm install jsonwebtoken
```

3. Edit the four const lines at the top of `gen_apple_secret.js`:
   - `TEAM_ID`: Your Apple Developer Team ID
   - `CLIENT_ID`: The Service ID you created (e.g. `com.buildwithai.travelapp.signin`)
   - `KEY_ID`: The Key ID of the private key you downloaded
   - `KEY_FILE`: The path to your downloaded .p8 file

4. Run the script:

```bash
node gen_apple_secret.js
```

5. Copy the printed JWT and use it in the Supabase setup in the next step.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Supabase Auth Provider">
    1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to `Authentication` > `Sign In / Providers` in the left sidebar
    2. Find `Apple` in the list of Auth Providers and click it to open the settings
    3. Toggle `Enable Sign in with Apple`
    4. Fill in the required fields:
       - **Client IDs**: The Service ID you created (e.g., `com.buildwithai.travelapp.signin`)
       - **Secret Key (for OAuth)**: Paste the generated client secret JWT from the previous step
    5. Click `Save`
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Enabling Apple Sign-In in Your App

Now that you've set up Apple Sign-In with Supabase, you need to enable the feature in your app codebase:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Follow the implementation instructions in the `integrations/apple-auth/README.md` file included in your boilerplate codebase. This file contains all necessary steps for setting up Apple Sign-In in your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you've completed the implementation steps, the Apple Sign-In button will appear in the authentication screens and be fully functional - on iOS only.

### Testing Your Configuration

To test your Apple Sign-In configuration:

1. Rebuild development build
2. Navigate to the sign-in screen
3. Tap the "Sign in with Apple" button
4. Complete the Apple authentication flow
5. Verify that you are successfully signed in to your app
