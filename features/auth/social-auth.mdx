## Setting up Social Authentication

Now that you have basic authentication working with Supabase, you can enhance your app by adding social authentication providers. This guide covers the general setup process for social authentication in your Supabase project.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up social authentication:

1. Make sure you've completed the basic [Supabase Setup](/quickstart/supabase-setup) in the Quick Start guide
2. Have your development build ready with the correct [URL configuration](/quickstart/development-build#update-supabase-url-configuration)
3. Ensure you have access to your app's developer accounts (Google/Apple)

### Available Social Providers

The boilerplate comes pre-configured for the following social authentication providers:

1. [Google Sign-In](/features/auth/google-auth)
   - Most widely used
   - Required for Android Play Store

2. [Apple Sign-In](/features/auth/apple-auth)
   - Required for iOS App Store
   - Automatically enabled for iOS users

### Next Steps

Now that you have set up authentication with Supabase for Expo Go testing, you can test the authentication flow in the Expo Go environment. When you're ready to test on a real device with a development build, follow the [Development Build guide](/quickstart/development-build) which includes instructions for updating your Supabase URL configuration for your app scheme.

After creating your development build, you can then configure additional social authentication providers:

- [Google Sign-In Setup](/docs/auth/google-signin-guide)
- [Apple Sign-In Setup](/features/auth/apple-auth)
