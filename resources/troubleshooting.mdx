## Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide addresses the most common issues you might encounter when working with the BuildWithAI+ boilerplate and provides step-by-step solutions to resolve them.

### Development Environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="screwdriver-wrench" title="Expo CLI Command Not Found">
    **Issue**: Running Expo commands results in "command not found" errors.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Ensure Expo CLI is installed globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```
    2. If you prefer not to install it globally, use npx:
    ```bash
    npx expo [command]
    ```
    3. Check if your PATH environment variable includes npm global packages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bug" title="Metro Bundler Issues">
    **Issue**: Metro bundler fails to start or crashes frequently.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Clear Metro cache:
    ```bash
    npx expo start -c
    ```
    2. Check for watchman issues (common on macOS):
    ```bash
    watchman watch-del-all
    ```
    3. Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies:
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="mobile" title="Device Connection Problems">
    **Issue**: Unable to connect to development server from physical device.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Ensure your phone and computer are on the same network.
    2. Try using the "tunnel" connection mode:
    ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel
    ```
    3. If using a development build, manually enter your computer's IP address in the app.
    4. Check if any firewalls or VPNs are blocking connections.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-xmark" title="Login or Signup Failures">
    **Issue**: Users unable to sign up or log in with Supabase.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Verify your Supabase URL and anon key in environment variables.
    2. Check Supabase dashboard for specific error messages.
    3. Ensure email confirmations are properly configured if you're requiring email verification.
    4. Check that redirect URLs are correctly set up in Supabase dashboard.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="brands-google" title="Social Authentication Errors">
    **Issue**: Social login with Google/Apple fails.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Verify OAuth client IDs and secrets are correctly set up.
    2. Check that redirect URLs in your OAuth provider match those in Supabase.
    3. For Apple Sign-In on iOS, ensure your provisioning profile has the capability enabled.
    4. Check your app's URL scheme in app.json matches what's expected for deep linking.
    5. In development, use the Expo development build as Expo Go has limitations with native auth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="link-slash" title="Session Persistence Problems">
    **Issue**: User sessions not persisting or unexpected logouts.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Check the session refresh mechanism in AuthProvider.
    2. Verify Supabase session duration settings.
    3. Look for errors in secure storage implementation.
    4. For iOS, ensure keychain sharing is properly configured for app groups if applicable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Push Notifications

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="bell-slash" title="Push Notifications Not Received">
    **Issue**: Push notifications are not being received on devices.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Verify FCM (Android) and APN (iOS) credentials are correctly set up.
    2. Check that device tokens are being properly registered with your backend.
    3. Ensure notifications have the correct payload structure.
    4. For iOS, verify push entitlements in your provisioning profile.
    5. For Android, check that Firebase is correctly configured.
    6. Use the Expo push notification tool to test token validity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="mobile-screen-button" title="Permission Issues">
    **Issue**: Unable to get push notification permissions.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Ensure you're requesting permissions at the right moment (not immediately at app start).
    2. Check the permission request implementation for each platform.
    3. For iOS, verify that you have the appropriate usage description in app.json.
    4. For Android, check AndroidManifest.xml for required permissions.
    5. If a user denied permissions, guide them to app settings to enable them manually.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### In-App Purchases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="RevenueCat Integration Issues">
    **Issue**: RevenueCat purchases not working properly.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Verify API keys are correctly configured.
    2. Ensure products are properly set up in App Store Connect and Google Play Console.
    3. Check that product IDs match between RevenueCat dashboard and your app code.
    4. For testing, verify you're using test accounts (sandbox for iOS, test track for Android).
    5. Review RevenueCat logs for specific error messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="receipt" title="Purchase Verification Issues">
    **Issue**: Purchases complete but entitlements not recognized.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Check customer ID generation and persistence logic.
    2. Verify entitlement mapping in RevenueCat dashboard.
    3. Implement proper receipt validation on purchase completion.
    4. Check for network connectivity issues during verification.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Build and Deployment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="hammer" title="EAS Build Failures">
    **Issue**: EAS builds fail with errors.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Check the build logs for specific error messages.
    2. Verify your eas.json configuration.
    3. Ensure all environment variables and secrets are properly set.
    4. For iOS, check provisioning profiles and certificates.
    5. For Android, verify keystore settings.
    6. Make sure all native dependencies are compatible with your Expo SDK version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="store" title="App Store/Play Store Rejection">
    **Issue**: App submission rejected by app stores.

       - In-app purchase implementations
       - Crash on review
       - Missing required permissions justifications

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gauge-high" title="App Running Slowly">
    **Issue**: App performance is sluggish, especially on older devices.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Use React DevTools to identify components that re-render unnecessarily.
    2. Implement memoization for expensive components using React.memo or useMemo.
    3. Use VirtualizedList or FlatList for long scrolling lists.
    4. Optimize images (resize, compress, consider using webP).
    5. Review animations and use native driver when possible.
    6. Check for memory leaks with useEffect cleanup functions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="image" title="Image Loading Issues">
    **Issue**: Images load slowly or cause jank when scrolling.
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Use image caching libraries like expo-image.
    2. Implement progressive loading strategies.
    3. Optimize image dimensions to match their display size.
    4. Convert large images to more efficient formats.
    5. Consider lazy loading images that are not in the initial viewport.
