export function InspirationCard({ title, description, imageUri }) {
  return (
    <View className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md overflow-hidden">
      <Image 
        source={{ uri: imageUri }} 
        className="h-48 w-full" 
      />
      <View className="p-4">
        <Text className="text-lg font-semibold">{title}</Text>
        <Text className="text-gray-500 mt-1">{description}</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
